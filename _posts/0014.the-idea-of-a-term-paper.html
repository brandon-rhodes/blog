title: The idea of a term paper
---
<p>
Displaying their usual talent for excerpt,
the folks at <a href="http://aldaily.com">Arts &amp; Letters Daily</a>
directed my attention to a recent article
in <a href="http://www.thesmartset.com/">The Smart Set</a>
with this intriguing summary of its contents:
</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Term paper mill.</b> Need $100 by Friday to keep the lights on? No sweat, if you’re a writer. Plenty of kids need ten pages on Hamlet by Thursday... <a href="http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article10100801.aspx">more»</a></p></blockquote>

<p>
The article,
entitled “<a href="http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article10100801.aspx"
 >Term Paper Artist</a>”,
alternates between hilarity and poignancy
as its author shares his adventures
writing hundreds of term papers for hire.
But near the end,
his tone suddenly becomes serious
as he turns to the question of <i>why</i> so many students
are unable to write term papers of their own.
He thinks that the reason is important enough
to stand alone in his article as a one-sentence paragraph.
Here is his preceding paragraph, and then the zinger:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It's not that I never felt a little skeevy writing
papers. Mostly it was a game, and a way to subsidize my more interesting
writing. Also, I've developed a few ideas of my own over the years. I
don't have the academic credentials of composition experts, but I doubt
many experts spent most of a decade writing between one and five term
papers a day on virtually every subject. I know something they don't
know; I know why students don't understand thesis statements,
argumentative writing, or proper citations.
</p>
<p>
It's because students have never read term papers.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is his diagnosis:
students never see what term papers are <i>supposed</i> to look like,
and so they have no idea how to produce them.
</p>

<p>
As he continued on,
ridiculing the idea that students
can produce something of which they are never once shown a good example,
I realized that his argument was exactly the same
as the one I made in my recent post
<a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2008/reading-code-curriculum/"
 >Reading Code: A Computer Science Curriculum</a>:
that the production of any kind of literature,
whether an essay in college or an elaborate routine in a computer program,
is an essentially imitative act.
Without being shown excellent examples
from the genre they are expected to produce,
students are left in the dark about what,
exactly, they are trying to generate —
and, more often than not, will fail.
They are never even given the opportunity
to demonstrate whether they do, in fact, lack the capacity to create,
because they are never shown the goal
towards which they are supposed to be striving.
