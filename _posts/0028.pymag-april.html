title: The April issue of Python Magazine

<p>
  It was back in the early 1990s,
  if memory serves me,
  that the Coca-Cola company —
  it may have been in one of their annual reports —
  decided to change their perspective.
  They declared that the soft drink market,
  of which they held more than 50%,
  was simply too small to remain their focus.
  Rather than wondering what marketing campaign
  might allow them to chip away a few more percentage points
  from their competitors,
  they drew attention to the fact
  that Coca-cola products represented only 2–3%
  of all fluids consumed, worldwide,
  and started thinking about how to increase <i>that</i> number.
  They decided, in other words, that their biggest competitor
  would no longer be Pepsi, but <i>water</i>.
</p>
<p>
  Now, think about the Python programming language,
  and try the same shift in perspective.
  Yes, we are all happy that readers of Linux Journal
  have selected
  <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10451"
     >Python as their Favorite Programming Language</a>
  in this year's “Reader's Choice Awards”
  and we are pleased when we move up a few more percentage points
  in something like the
  <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html"
     >TIOBE Programming Community Index</a>.
  But comparing our market share
  with that of other programming languages can,
  too often,
  fool us into thinking that we are playing a zero-sum game
  in which our own community can expand
  only by prying other programmers' fingers
  off of the languages they currently know and love.
</p>
<p>
  Try something else.
  Imagine <i>all</i> of the world's people, and ask:
  what percentage of <i>them</i> use Python?
  And what might it look like to increase <i>that</i> percentage?
  You will suddenly think of the grade school down the street,
  where you could volunteer one afternoon a week
  teaching Python programming at their computer club.
  You will realize that the local community college
  provides a simple IT curriculum,
  but gives their students no information
  about getting connected to a local programmer user's group.
  You will begin to wonder what difference simple Python skills
  might make in the hands of teenagers, college students,
  and young families raising children.
</p>
<p>
  You will, in other words,
  start thinking about how to change the world.
</p>
<p>
  And the reason that I'm excited about the
  April issue of Python Magazine
  is that our cover stories focus on Python programmers who,
  during the recent high-profile United States elections,
  made this kind of step outward
  into realizing what Python could do in their communities.

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.mitchtrachtenberg.com/"
       >Mitch Trachtenberg</a> has written our feature article,
    about how his ballot scanning software
    helped election volunteers and officials
    in Humboldt County, California,
    discover that nearly 200 ballots had not been counted
    by their Premier Elections Solutions voting systems.
    Thanks to his efforts,
    California has now de-certified that particular software
    from being used in elections in their state.
  </li>
  <li>
    We also have an interview with
    <a href="http://bcn.boulder.co.us/~neal/"
       >Neal McBurnett</a>,
    whose <a href="http://www.electionaudits.org/"
             >ElectionAudits</a> software
    automated the statistical calculations in Boulder, Colorado,
    that allowed their election audits to focus on close races
    where more ballots have to be checked
    before a winner can be certified with confidence.
  </li>
  <li>
    To celebrate the fact that April 22nd was
    <a href="http://plone.org/events/wpd">World Plone Day</a>,
    we feature an <b>Introduction to Plone</b>
    with instructions for quickly downloading,
    installing, and customizing this popular Content Management System.
  </li>
  <li>
    Our more technical articles describe how to
    <b>create your own domain-specific language</b>
    with a parser that gets invoked
    when you run <tt>import</tt> on a file
    with an extension of your own choosing,
    and how to <b>create a protocol simulation framework</b>
    that lets you experiment
    with how packets will traverse a network.
    And Mark Mruss offers another Welcome to Python article
    that this time covers <b>Python dictionaries</b>,
    whose usefulness and elegant design were certainly a big part
    of my own adoption of the language.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally,
    <a href="http://holdenweb.com/">Steve Holden</a>
    shares his perspective as head of the Python Software Foundation,
    this time reflecting on the wonderful
    <b>success of PyCon 2009</b> last month.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I hope you'll take a look at this month's issue,
  and I hope that you learn as much from reading it
  as I myself learned from the process of editing.
  Enjoy!
