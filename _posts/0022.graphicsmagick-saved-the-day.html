title: GraphicsMagick saved the day
---
<p>
I had never heard of
<a href="http://www.graphicsmagick.org/">GraphicsMagick</a> until yesterday,
when I discovered that the venerable, if clunky,
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> suite
was ruining one of my customer's print jobs
by producing invalid PDF files.
This is actually the third major failure
that this particular project has encountered
because of flaws in standard open-source document tools.
In this and my next two blog posts,
I will outline the bugs that I have encountered,
in the hopes of saving some future reader
the time that it took me to track them down.
</p>
<p>
But I will begin the series rather simply,
with the first two lessons that I learned during the project:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>1. Always verify PDF correctness with Adobe Acrobat.</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
The trusty <a href="http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/">Xpdf</a>
viewer, with which I have viewed PDF files for years,
turns out to have a remarkable ability
to decipher and display even somewhat damaged PDF files.
That's a great feature — <i>if</i> someone else has produced the PDF,
and you just need to read it, whether it's damaged or not.
But this “feature” becomes a problem
if you have just <i>produced</i>
a PDF, and want to know about any errors in the file
before your customer does!
</p>
<p>
In this situation, Adobe's
<a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/">Acrobat Reader</a>
should be your viewer of choice.
Not only is it probably the software
that your customers will be using anyway,
but it is — and this seems intentional on Adobe's part —
a very stringent interpreter.
The error it displays for a corrupt PDF, I must admit,
is among the least-informative I have seen this month:
</p>
<pre>
There was a problem reading this document (14)
</pre>
<p>
But the information that this <i>does</i> yield is invaluable:
your customer will not be able to see or print this PDF
until you find the bug in your toolchain and fix the result.
It is, of course, objectionable and problematic
to have to install a closed-source product
on what might otherwise be a completely clean development system;
but I have found it irreplaceable
for its ability to show me problems
before my customers see them.
</p>
<p>
This mistake cost me more time than you might imagine.
The tool chain I built for my customer generates
several intermediate PDF files,
and it turns out that the error was happening
fairly early in the process —
so that one of the first files produced,
and therefore each subsequent PDF,
was invalid and could not be opened with Acrobat.
But because I was viewing them all with Xpdf,
I spent many minutes looking at the final step in the chain
and wondering why that PDF tool was often dying,
when the PDFs it was consuming looked so good in my viewer!
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>2. Avoid <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>
6.3.7 when producing PDFs;
try <a href="http://www.graphicsmagick.org/">GraphicsMagick</a> instead!</b>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
More recent versions of ImageMagick might not have any problem
producing PDF files from PNG images,
but the ImageMagick that currently ships with Debian unstable,
version 6.3.7,
seems to have routine problems trying to turn some of my customer's
PNG files into valid PDFs.
To avoid having to compile, install, and maintain
my own version of ImageMagick,
I cast around for an alternative,
and was startled when Google brought me to
the <a href="http://www.graphicsmagick.org/">GraphicsMagick</a> project!
Here was ImageMagick done right:
instead of creating dozens of commands on your system,
as though this were the 1970s,
GraphicsMagick defines a single <tt>gm</tt> binary
with multiple sub-commands:
</p>
<pre>
$ gm convert watermark.png watermark.pdf
</pre>
<p>
Check out their web site for more great features;
but I'm simply happy that the PDFs it has produced so far
have been clean, correct, and consistent.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
A question for my readers:
can a good, open-source PDF checker be found somewhere,
that is at least as stringent as Adobe Acrobat?
Leave a comment below if you have a suggestion;
such a tool would have made this project considerably easier!
