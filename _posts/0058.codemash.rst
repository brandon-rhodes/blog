title: Why am I going to CodeMash?
---

By this time tomorrow I will doubtless be wearing swimming trunks —
in northern Ohio — *in winter* —
while listening to people rave about Java and C# and Ruby
and wondering what I have gotten myself into.
I will be at `CodeMash <http://codemash.org/>`_,
a conference that was started by developers
who wanted an event that focused solely on the programmer
while including a wide range of languages and technologies.

It was lucky that I signed up
the moment that CodeMash 2012 registration opened back in October,
because the 1,200 conference tickets
sold out in only **20 minutes** —
no event in the Python community
had prepared me for that kind of demand!

I learned about CodeMash conference from its co-founder
`Brian Prince <http://brianhprince.com/>`_
when we were fellow speakers at `PyOhio <http://pyohio.org/>`_ last July.
So why did a Python programmer like me decide to attend?

* Even though the technologies that Brian chooses
  are different from mine,
  he is clearly animated by the same passion
  for combining good code with good community.
  If his co-founders are at all like him,
  then I knew that a great event was in the works.

* I want to learn another conference's culture.
  For example, I was stunned to see strong suggestions
  on the CodeMash mailing list
  that attendees should *not* carry laptops —
  instead, they recommend pencil, paper,
  and something they call
  `Sketchnotes <http://www.dachisgroup.com/2011/12/the-sketchnote-revolution/>`_.
  Since good teachers have a reflex
  that makes them try to bring the whole audience along with them
  as they make a point,
  we could actually be slowing up PyCon speakers
  when half the audience is face-down typing
  and clearly a half step behind what is being said.

* I could predict that moving to
  `Bluffton, Ohio <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluffton,_Ohio>`_,
  as winter descended
  would leave me with very few opportunities
  to meet other developers.
  After several weeks of being the only programmer I know,
  a large regional conference
  will let me bask in the company
  of other people who understand what I do for a living.

* It is too easy to judge other languages
  by what I think are drawbacks in their design,
  or by the poor code that most programmers produce
  whatever their language.
  I want see what excites the real experts
  who solve interesting problems using Java, Ruby, and C# —
  people who use those languages to the hilt, and do a great job of it.

* Being evangelized by smart people is interesting and humbling,
  if you let down your guard and really listen.
  And hearing Ruby and C# people explain the glories of their languages
  will remind me of how I must sound
  when I hold forth on the advantages of Python,
  or `Emacs <http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`_,
  or `Vibram Fivefingers <http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/>`_.

* Brian wants to make CodeMash more popular for Python programmers —
  and a few luminaries like Bruce Eckel, Mike Pirnat, and Mark Ramm
  are already on the schedule this year.
  Next year I might offer to speak.
  But first I wanted to show up and just listen,
  figure out the vibe of the conference,
  and learn more about what is happening
  outside of the Python community.

* Finally, it does sound like great fun:
  eating, drinking, and being merry
  at an `indoor water park resort <http://www.kalahariresorts.com/oh/>`_
  in the middle of an Ohio winter.
  Kalahari, here I come!
