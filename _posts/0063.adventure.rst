title: Adventure in Python 3
---

I have just released
`adventure 1.2 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/adventure/>`_
on the Python Package Index,
an update of my Python 3 port
of the original Colossal Cave Adventure game
that I announced last year during the final round of
`PyCon 2011 lightning talks <http://pyvideo.org/video/357/pycon-2011--sunday-afternoon-lightning-talks>`_.

“Adventure” was the first game
to offer players a world to explore at their own pace,
driven by their own curiosity.
With simple one- and two-word commands
like ``ENTER`` ``BUILDING`` and ``GET`` ``LAMP``,
as well as cardinal directions
that could, mercifully, be typed as abbreviations
(``N``, ``NE``, ``E``, ``SE``, and so forth,
with ``U`` and ``D`` for up and down),
you entered a series of caves —
based realistically on a section
of the Flint-Mammoth cave system in Kentucky
that the author himself had helped explore —
and could start collecting treasures in a quest
that involved danger, magic, and even encounters
with a few other characters,
who rustled in the shadows beyond the range of your lamp
before finally pouncing.

Keep reading if you want to learn
about several discoveries that I made
while porting “Adventure” to Python!
If you want to know more about the history of the original game itself,
I recommend Dennis G. Jerz's admirably thorough paper
“`Somewhere Nearby is Colossal Cave: Examining Will Crowther's Original "Adventure" in Code and in Kentucky <http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/001/2/000009/000009.html>`_”
from the Summer 2007 issue of the Digital Humanities Quarterly.
