<p>
  The August issue of Python Magazine is out,
  and the cover issue is one of the most exciting
  that I have had the privilege to publish.
  Following up on his popular talk at PyCon 2009,
  professor of computer science
  <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~punch/">Dr. Bill Punch</a>
  has written an article for us with his colleague
  <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~enbody/">Dr. Richard Enbody</a>
  about replacing C++ with Python
  in Michigan State University's introductory programming class.
</p>
<p>
  The difficulty they faced
  was that the second and subsequent classes
  in Michigan State's curriculum have continued using the C++ language;
  only the initial course could change to Python.
  While non-majors taking the introductory course
  get to learn Python and leave,
  the computer science majors
  have to then start the second course
  without any specific knowledge of C++.
  How much, skeptics wondered, would it hurt the Python students
  to be a full semester behind in their C++ knowledge
  compared to students
  who took the “old” C++ version of the introductory course?
</p>
<p>
  The circumstances at Michigan State wound up being perfect
  for making the change to Python a full-fledged,
  statistically valid experiment
  to determine how much student grades would be hurt
  because of the switch.
  Read the article for the detailed results,
  but I can report — with great satisfaction —
  that the Python students
  proved themselves the equals of their C++ peers,
  and also that <i>very</i> exciting and unexpected results ensued
  among the students whom the study was <i>not</i> looking at:
  the non-majors, for which this was their only programming course,
  and the seasoned grad students,
  who rolled up their sleeves and learned Python
  in order to be able to TA the course.
  Again, see the article for all of the details!

  What else do we have this month?
  Articles about how easy concurrency becomes with
  <a href="http://www.stackless.com/">Stackless Python</a>;
  about documenting your software projects
  using the powerful <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/"
                        >Sphinx documentation system</a>;
  about creating simple graphs with the industry-strength
  <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">matplotlib
  plotting library</a>;
  a guide to the details of hashing algorithms,
  and how they relate to the Python dictionary implementation;
  and, finally, the usual thoughts and ponderings
  from both myself and from
  <a href="http://holdenweb.com/"
