<p>
It was with regret that I tendered my resignation yesterday
as the Editor-in-Chief of Python Magazine.
While the publisher will keep producing the magazine
by distributing PDFs on the web site,
the transition to the new format has dragged on long enough —
both for both myself and our customers —
that I have run out of enthusiasm.
My last responsibility
will be to shepherd the February and March issues
through the publishing process
and safely on to the PDF readers of our subscribers.
</p>
<p>
I hope that the authors featured in the October issue will forgive me
for not writing my usual blog post last year touting their achievements;
I had just received the sad news that the publisher
could no longer afford the rising costs
of printing and shipping Python Magazine,
and I did not want to further advertise the magazine
until its fate was certain one way or the other.
</p>
<p>
I have by no means been a perfect editor.
In particular,
the publisher hoped that I would get the magazine —
which was running eight weeks late —
back on schedule.
Instead, my bumbling first month as editor
made the magazine an additional week late,
and by the time I hit my stride in May it was another week behind.
Although the schedule then stabilized at a steady ten weeks late,
I never did manage to start reeling the fish back in.
The only metric, I suppose, which I can really claim to my credit
is that I oversaw a nineteen-fold increase
in the number of em-dashes in the magazine —
247 appeared over the course of 2009,
up from only 13 the year before!
</p>
<p>
I should express thanks to my co-workers:
Arbi, Emanuela, and Cathleen are smart, helpful, and professional,
and were patient with me as I learned the ropes.
Doug Hellmann gave me ample training as he handed over the reins,
and also supported the magazine later as an acquisitions editor.
Several associate editors performed solid reviews of incoming articles.
And, of course, the greatest privilege of being Editor-in-Chief
was to help such a wide array of voices from the Python community
find their way into print —
from Steve Holden,
the illustrious chair of the Python Software Foundation,
to young Meran Cambpell-Hood,
an eleven-year-old from New Zealand
who described using Python for the first time
to process data for her science fair project.

<p>
Which reminds me:
the authors from the October issue
never got their moment in the spotlight!
The article by <b>Meran Campbell-Hood</b> about her science fair
project was the most fun to edit,
but every single article was interesting and taught me something.
Steve Holden interviewed <b>James Tauber</b>
about the secrets of a successful Python start-up;
<b>Yusdi Santoso</b> finished his two-part series
on the Python program he wrote to produce the PDF
for the beautiful EuroPython brochure last year;
the original editor of Python Magazine, <b>Brian Jones</b>,
returned to talk about why he now tends
to choose Django for web projects rather than PHP;
and <b>Joe Amenta</b> introduced his "3to2" project,
which will help Python programmers
support their old Python 2 users while still moving ahead
with the transition to Python 3.
Finally, <b>Greg Newman</b> explained how to turn Emacs
into a powerful Python IDE,
and <b>Steve Holden</b> and myself
rounded out the issue with our usual editorializing.
</p>
<p>
With many of the rest of you,
I am eager to see the debut of the new
<a href="http://pythonmagazine.com/">Python Magazine web site</a>.
And I look forward to seeing everyone
at PyCon 2010
in less than three weeks!
While I will not have the joy that I did last year
of walking the halls of PyCon as a newly-minted Editor-in-Chief,
able to make dreams come true
and grant the fame and fortune of being a published author,
I will at least enjoy being a developer among developers
in the best programming language community on Earth!
