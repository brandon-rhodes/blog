# Essential Reading

Each of the following articles and essays
(the list is still under construction!)
stuck with me after I first read it,
becoming part of how I look at the world.
I’m listing them here in one place
so it’s easier for me to find them.

**“So you want to be a consultant...?”**
[unixwiz.net](http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/be-consultant.html) —
The foundation of my career:
it’s this article that gave me the confidence
to quit my day job back in 2008
and become a freelance programmer,
like the independent programmers I’d met at Python and Plone conferences.
How did it instill confidence?
By explaining the customer relationship
and the operation of the small business
in such detail
that I could imagine trying it out myself.
Its advice on how to treat customers
offers sterling guidelines
for simply how to treat other humans in general.

“Let’s say every company gets about three innovation tokens.”
Starting from this premise,
a veteran of Etsy’s early startup years
explores the risks of building new projects
on new and unfamiliar technologies.
Even my personal projects are often improved
if I remember this article
and weigh the benefits of novelty versus the benefits of boring!

**“A Whirlwind Tutorial on Creating Really Teensy ELF Executables for Linux”**
[muppetlabs.com](https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html)
—
A delight!
Starting with the question of why even the smallest C program
compiles to a Linux file nearly 4k bytes long,
this deep dive into the ELF executable format
is at first admirably clever,
then startlingly clever,
and finally fiendishly clever
in its quest to create the smallest viable Linux executable.
Several useful tools are introduced along the way.
