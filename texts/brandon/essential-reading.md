# Essential Reading

Each of the following articles and essays
(the list is still under construction!)
stuck with me after I first read it,
becoming part of how I look at the world.
I’m listing them here in one place
so it’s easier for me to find them.

**“So you want to be a consultant...?”**
[unixwiz.net](http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/be-consultant.html) —
The foundation of my career:
it’s this article that gave me the confidence
to quit my day job back in 2008
and become a freelance programmer,
like the independent programmers I’d met at Python and Plone conferences.
How did it instill confidence?
By explaining the customer relationship
and the operation of the small business
in such detail
that I could imagine trying it out myself.
Its advice on how to treat customers
offers sterling guidelines
for simply how to treat other humans in general.

**“Choose Boring Technology”**

—
“Let’s say every company gets about three innovation tokens.”
Starting from this premise,
a veteran of Etsy’s early startup years
explores the risks of building new projects
on new and unfamiliar technologies.
Even my personal projects are often improved
if I remember this article
and weigh the benefits of novelty versus the benefits of boring!

**“The Tau Manifesto”**
[tauday.com](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto)
—
This delightful essay
explores a facet of modern math notation
for which tradition has stranded us with a sub-optimal solution:
the use of 𝜋 for the irrational circumference of a circle
instead of the far more natural 𝜏 = 2𝜋.
It’s a masterwork in how to evaluate rival notations
when seeking clarity, economy, and meaning.

**“A Whirlwind Tutorial on Creating Really Teensy ELF Executables for Linux”**
[muppetlabs.com](https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html)
—
A delight!
Starting with the question of why even the smallest C program
compiles to a Linux file nearly 4k bytes long,
this deep dive into the ELF executable format
is at first admirably clever,
then startlingly clever,
and finally fiendishly clever
in its quest to create the smallest viable Linux executable.
Several useful tools are introduced along the way.

**“The Really Big One”**
[The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one)
—
I enjoyed re-reading this article several times after it was published.
After an opening that perfectly blends tension, humor, and science,
Kathryn Schulz brings the energy of a mystery novel
to a recent advance in seismology.
I always get a shiver down my spine
when the year that the trees drowned
winds up matching the date from Genroku Japan!
More broadly, the article reminds us that scientific consensus —
no matter how often we enjoy wielding it against each other in debates —
can be dead wrong.
