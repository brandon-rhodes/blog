title: PyCon Trivia Night, Second Edition
---

Like the first year that the conference was in Montréal,
I was invited to lead a dinner trivia contest
at one of the two evening dinners that PyCon 2015 featured
on the night of the first full conference day.

Wanting to help the audience celebrate
all of the advances that are being made in Python 3,
I skewed my questions heavily in the direction
of the strides that the core developers are taking
with the new version of the language.

Alas — my focus was not as popular with the audience
as I had hoped!
It turns out that Python 2.7 is still far more popular
than its predecessor,
and many contestants were frustrated
about being asked so many questions and details
about a language hardly anybody used.
So I made a promise to the audience:
if a third trivia dinner happens at PyCon 2016 in Portland,
that I will make it Retro Python Trivia Night
and ask all of the questions about the Python 2 series!

The questions follow,
well-separated from the answers at the bottom of the post
so that you can try answering them on your own
before you scroll down and peek.
Enjoy!
