<h1>Talks</h1>

<p class="note">
  A conference lasts only a few days.
  But when organizers are able to record the talks and keynotes,
  the event can impact hundreds more people
  who were not able to attend.
  Here are some of my own efforts to get up on stage
  and share what I have learned
  with the communities that have given me so much!

    What are the key features of a modern dynamic language like Python
    that let a programmer make progress even against difficult problems,
    even on days when things are not going well? Starting simple and
    then ramping up to complex, Brandon takes us from how beginners can
    use a Python dictionary to pair up matching data, to how to use
    ctypes to work around limitations in the built-in Python SSL module,
    as he takes us through the tools and approaches that for a Python
    programmer are all part of a day's work — the features without which
    we would not be as productive.

    Warsaw was the perfect venue
    for reflecting on how Mikołaj Kopernik —
    the Polish astronomer who published in Latin as “Copernicus” —
    faced the perennial problem of refactoring,
    when he saw redundant code repeated all through
    Ptolemy's model of the solar system.

    Continuing where my PyCon Canada talk left off,
    I explore several common practices for choosing names wisely
    when writing Python code
    — and suggest that apt names are the lifeline
    that keep programmers afloat in dynamic languages.

    To introduce the wonderful conveniences of scientific Python
    to the crowd at CodeMash,
    where the majority platforms are Ruby, .NET, and Java,
    I showed how the IPython Notebook can be combined
    with basic astronomy libraries
    to create tools with which to explore the Solar System.

    This was my very first experience with being an invited speaker,
    where I could choose any topic I wanted
    instead of having to submit a competitive proposal.
    I wanted to use this opportunity by filling the talk
    with the kind of miscellaneous, practical coding advice
    that so rarely fits the agenda of a more serious proposal.
    Instead, one single topic wound up filling the whole time slot:
    how we format and indent Python code
    as a personal and intentional act of graphic design.

    I had recently seen a talk
    that dismissed the idea
    that Python programming involves design patterns,
    and I realized that I disagreed:
    there are all kinds of patterns emerging in the Python community,
    as well as widespread use of many of the classic patterns.
    As a first step towards the topic
    (hence the “1” in the talk title —
    it is, hopefully, the first of several talks on the subject),
    I look at the continuing popularity of many of the
    classic Gang of Four patterns even in modern Python programming.

    Another whirlwind technical introduction
    in the style of my previous talk on Python dictionaries.
    This time, I tackle how modern operating systems
    allocate and manage memory by using a simple example memory image
    that intends to capture all of the essential moving parts
    while being as simple in its details as possible.

    Too often, programmers use ORMs to hide from their database
    and avoid learning how it works.
    Instead, I encourage programmers to learn a bit of SQL
    and become familiar with the problems that database queries
    are designed to solve well.
    In this talk, I outline the basics
    of using SQLAlchemy to craft efficient queries
    and avoid several common database query anti-patterns.

    Fred Brooks said famously that our data structures
    are the most important thing about our computer programs,
    yet a generation of programmers is trying to use ORMs
    to avoid learning how SQL really structures their data.
    This talk is a basic plea for programmers to jump in
    and really understand their data store,
    whether it is a relational database, a key-value store,
    or something else.

    Objects in a dynamic language can be slippery:
    merely accessing an attribute can make it appear,
    disappear, or even change value, at the whim of whatever
    overly clever programmer designed the object you are accessing.
    This talk looks at strategies and technologies
    for getting behind shifting dynamic behaviors
    to see the properties of an object
    without the risk of affecting its state.

    Object-orientation is a troubled programming approach that,
    because of its popularity in the 1990s,
    wound up afflicting great swaths of the Python Standard Library.
    By looking at specific examples
    in several popular web-related modules,
    we will see the problems that are created
    when an API author tries to invite you inside of their classes
    to become a co-developer with them.

    For the educators among us, I suggest a visceral metaphor
    by which newer programmers might be able to understand and predict
    the moment at which an object or data structure
    will be freed from Python's memory.

    For most Python programmers,
    the behaviors of the dictionary data type are simply memorized:
    instant access by key, keys must be immutable,
    and order is arbitrary and shifting.
    But what technology is behind these bizarre features?
    This talk goes behind the scenes
    with bright, colorful, simple diagrams
    to show exactly how Python's most popular data structure works.

    An account on a shared Unix machine
    is usually a dicey platform on which to deploy a Python web app,
    but Webfaction uses interesting approaches
    to keep users fairly well sandboxed.
    So I gave a PyCon talk on their techniques,
    which could be applied on one's own systems
    to help keep apps separate.
    Of course, boxes have become cheap enough
    in the intervening few years
    that most people now spin up a separate machine per web application
    without even having to think about it!

    Web development often involves bringing together
    many different components to build a single site.
    Authentication, social networking, media management,
    and content management are examples of the kind of features
    that are often powered by third-party modules or extensions.
    This talk introduces Zope's adapter registry
    and how a declarative web framework like Grok
    lets you use the “Adapter” gang-of-four design pattern
    to link components together into a cleanly functioning site.
