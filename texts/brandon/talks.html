<h1>Talks</h1>

<p class="note">
  A conference lasts only a few days.
  But when organizers are able to record the talks and keynotes,
  the event can impact hundreds more people
  who were not able to attend.
  Here are some of my own efforts to get up on stage
  and share what I have learned
  with the communities that have given me so much!

    Just because a programming pattern or convention becomes popular
    doesn’t always mean that it’s a good idea.
    This talk digs into the consensus
    that the Python community has built
    around what constitutes “Pythonic” code,
    with a focus on cases where the conventional wisdom may be wrong.
    I knew that many audience members at code::dive
    would be programmers in compiled languages like C++,
    so the talk is designed to introduce the features of a dynamic language
    and the same time as it discusses how code in such a language
    can become more readable and more effective.

    The ancient Greeks hypothesized that the southern hemisphere
    had a temperate zone matching that of the northern hemisphere,
    where there existed a separate human race
    standing upside down compared to ourselves.
    I celebrate my first visit to Australia
    by considering several ways
    in which I find myself upside down,
    both when crafting personal communications,
    and also public texts such as tweets.

    How much does the quality of our tools influence the problems we
    solve? I look at several examples of how good tools can lower the
    “activation energy” necessary to make a problem worth tackling.
    After looking at several examples of how a novel tool has
    transformed my habits, I look at how Python's simplicity let me help
    a beginning programmer solve some questions we had about an upcoming
    Grand Canyon hike!

  <h2>Python as C++’s limiting case</h2>

  </p>
  <p>
    The Python language’s memory model can be deduced from first
    principles: simply take modern C++ conventions and drive their
    safety and generality to infinity. But this limiting case generates
    its own compromises and opens its own categories of possible runtime
    errors. This talk explores the position Python has staked out in the
    language design space of correctness versus performance, the choices
    Python programmers make when they need to move closer to C++, and
    the ways that the C++ community keeps adopting conventions that look
    suspiciously like Python.

    My Skyfield astronomy library generates planet and satellite
    positions for Python programmers. How can a library that accepts a
    time argument and returns a position be used the other way around:
    to search for the time and date that a particular circumstance
    occurs? Using several techniques to search for rising and setting
    times, I was able to schedule a final glimpse of the space station
    Tiangong-1 hours before it burned up in our planet’s atmosphere!

    I got several questions after my PyCon 2017 talk
    about how I had programmed its ASCII-art animations.
    But I didn’t wind up releasing the underlying animation library —
    it was simply too horrible!
    In this exposé I describe how my library worked,
    explain where the design went wrong,
    and reveal an improved design which I have now open-sourced
    from the ashes of the original.

    Since my “Mighty Dictionary” talk at PyCon 2010, the Python dictionary has evolved dramatically. This talk discusses iterable views, the dictionary’s dedicated comprehension syntax, random key ordering, the special key-sharing dictionary designed to underlie object collections, and, most famously of all, the new “compact dictionary” that cuts dictionary storage substantially — and carries a fascinating side-effect.

    Skilled workers traditionally build time into their schedule
    to stop and sharpen their tools.
    But programmers, working under tight deadlines,
    often avoid stopping
    to automate a repetitious process,
    or to reconfigure an awkward setting in their editor —
    and, as a result, can waste hours fighting their tools.
    What kinds of tools should a programmer take the time
    to surround themselves with for the greatest productivity?

    Python string operations are profligate in their use of memory — the
    steps necessary to parse an HTTP request often make four or five

    reduces copying, but finds that it can only improve the performance
    of a few specific I/O operations.

    Ancient scientists did not wait around for Python to be invented,
    but went ahead and built a model of the universe
    using more primitive means of calculation.
    But today we can finally bring their work up to date!
    By applying data analysis and in-browser visualization
    to the best and most accurate modern astronomical data,
    we will rebuild the ancient and medieval model of the universe —
    from the orbit of the Moon all the way up to the highest heaven.
    In the process we will see how vector math, statistical solvers,
    plotting libraries, and animation can all be brought together

    Problems like the fact that data wants to live on big servers,

    While Tolkien had friends who could devise ingenious ways
    to critique his work without sounding critical,
    he had others whose remarks were merciless and direct —
    to the point that Tolkien simply stopped sharing new chapters
    as he wrote The Lord of the Rings.
    As programmers we endure many of the struggles of writers and artists,
    and often react just as badly to critique of our code.
    From Tolkien’s experience we will draw lessons
    about how to make critique generous instead of damaging,
    and actionable instead of personal.

    Python programmers already use many design patterns in their work.
    Each pattern distills the wisdom the community has learned over the years,
    often at great expense, and makes it available to younger programmers.
    But even design-conscious programmers
    often find their applications growing more difficult to test and expand.
    In this talk,
    we will learn about how the recently propounded “Clean Architecture”
    applies to Python applications,
    and how this high-level design pattern fits particularly well
    with the features of the Python language.

    Modern operating systems sandbox each process
    inside of a virtual memory map from which direct I/O operations
    are generally impossible.
    Instead, a process has to ask the operating system
    every time it wants to modify a file
    or communicate bytes over the network.
    By using operating system specific tools
    to watch the system calls a Python script is making —
    using “strace” under Linux or “truss” under Mac OS X —
    you can study how a program is behaving
    and address several different kinds of bugs.

    Why are Python programmers crazy about lists and dictionaries, when
    other languages tout bitmaps, linked lists, and B+ trees? Are we
    missing out? Come learn how data structures are implemented on bare
    metal, how to select the right data structure, how the list and
    dictionary cover a wide swath of use cases, and when to dip into the
    Standard Library for an alternative.

    For programmers, perhaps the most annoying thing about our prejudices
    is the rate at which they go out of date.
    Your reasons for choosing your operating system, editor,
    version-control system, and web framework were —
    of course — perfect and provable at the time that you made your choice,
    and anyone who disagreed with you was an obvious nitwit.
    But what happens when the competing editor suddenly improves?
    When that blocker in the rival database is removed?
    The choice between Python web frameworks is the same way.
    We will look at how Django has recently been improving
    by leaps and bounds, invalidating old prejudices against it
    with every recent release.

    <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/">PyEphem</a> in 1998.
    Built with <a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>,
    it made astronomical calculations in Python
    only slightly more convenient than writing them directly in C.
    A rewrite five years later improved the interface,
    but a decade of fielding user questions has convinced me
    to re-think how an API should help programmers cope
    with an unfamiliar and complex domain like astronomy.
    This talk will explore how API design,

    What are the key features of a modern dynamic language like Python
    that let a programmer make progress even against difficult problems,
    even on days when things are not going well? Starting simple and
    then ramping up to complex, Brandon takes us from how beginners can
    use a Python dictionary to pair up matching data, to how to use
    ctypes to work around limitations in the built-in Python SSL module,
    as he takes us through the tools and approaches that for a Python
    programmer are all part of a day's work — the features without which
    we would not be as productive.

    I wanted to use this opportunity by filling the talk

    I had recently seen a talk
    that dismissed the idea
    that Python programming involves design patterns,
    and I realized that I disagreed:
    there are all kinds of patterns emerging in the Python community,
    as well as widespread use of many of the classic patterns.
    As a first step towards the topic
    (hence the “1” in the talk title —
    it is, hopefully, the first of several talks on the subject),
    I look at the continuing popularity of many of the
    classic Gang of Four patterns even in modern Python programming.

    Too often, programmers use ORMs to hide from their database

    Instead, I encourage programmers to learn a bit of SQL

    are designed to solve well.
    In this talk, I outline the basics
    of using SQLAlchemy to craft efficient queries
    and avoid several common database query anti-patterns.

    Object-orientation is a troubled programming approach that,
    because of its popularity in the 1990s,
    wound up afflicting great swaths of the Python Standard Library.
    By looking at specific examples

    Objects in a dynamic language can be slippery:

    disappear, or even change value, at the whim of whatever
    overly clever programmer designed the object you are accessing.

    For most Python programmers,

    Authentication, social networking, media management,
