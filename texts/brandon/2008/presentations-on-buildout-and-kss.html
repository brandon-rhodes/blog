title: Presentations on Buildout and KSS
---
<p>
After several frustrating weeks learning how to create, edit, and publish a screencast under Linux (about which I will write a separate post), I have now published screencasts of both presentations that I gave at the PyAtl meetup in January. I opened with a talk about the <tt>import</tt> statement, and where Python packages lived before egg files were invented:
</p>

<div class="figure"><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5996823626349389448"><b>Python Before Eggs</b></a>

<embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=5996823626349389448&hl=en" flashvars=""> </embed>

</div>

<p>
The audience seemed most interested in the last section of the talk, where I discuss three techiques for debugging problems with Python's <tt>import</tt> statement; fast-forward to around 3:00 if you want to catch that part by itself.
</p>

<p>
Next, Jeremy Jones spoke about eggs, Noah Gift introduced virtualenv, and, finally, I got back up to talk about buildout. This was probably <b>my own favorite</b> among the recent presentations I have given, and it's the one I've worked hardest to adapt to a competent screencast:

<div class="figure"><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3428163188647461098&hl=en"><b>Introduction to Buildout</b></a>

<embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=3428163188647461098&hl=en" flashvars=""> </embed>

</div>

<p>
I have prepared a supplement to the above screencast that <a href="/brandon/buildout/">gives additional hints and tips about using buildout</a>, as well as a link to the source code of the module that I use as my example.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if you're ready to see something a little less polished — something that instead of being a screencast is actually a film of me talking in front of a live audience, and gesturing and jumping around — I filled a vacant lightning-talk slot at our February PyAtl meeting with an impromptu introduction to <a href="http://kssproject.org/">Kinetic Style Sheets</a> (KSS), using an example application that was still sitting on my laptop after at a Georgia Tech developer's luncheon earlier that week:
</p>

<div class="figure"><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3829442611478268688"><b>Introduction to KSS</b></a>

<p>
Now I can finally turn my attention to preparing for my upcoming talk at PyCon 2008 in Chicago! I will be talking about the basic “adapter” design pattern, and how a framework like Zope 3 can facilitate its use. Stay tuned for more information!
