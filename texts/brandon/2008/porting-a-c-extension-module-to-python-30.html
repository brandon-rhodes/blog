title: Porting a C extension module to Python 3.0
---
<p>
With several packages already advertising
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=browse&c=214&c=534"
 >Python 3.0 compatibility</a>,
it seemed high time to look into releasing my
<a href="http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/">PyEphem astronomy package</a>
in an edition compatible with the new language.
But I hesitated:
how difficult is it <i>really</i>,
and how many hours of work will it consume,
to port a C-language extension module to Python 3.0?
</p>
<p>
The answer is that,
while the necessary changes were surprisingly easy,
they took lots of time to figure out
because I did not find them documented in any one place.
I offer the following notes to assist
any other adventurers who want to experiment
with porting their extension modules to 3.0.
These notes might also suggest
useful additions to the official documentation.
</p>
<p>
But, first, I need to issue three cautions.
To develop under 3.0, you may have to forego several Python tools
that you probably thought you could no longer do without.
The world of 3.0 is a windswept and icy landscape
from which the glaciers have just receded,
and you will find the stone tools rather primitive
when compared to the comforts of civilization
that you enjoy under Python 2.
To wit:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I cannot find
 <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/1.3.1">virtualenv</a>
 for 3.0,
 which is a disaster.
 This means that you have to create a separate Python 3.0 install,
 built with a different <tt>--prefix</tt> option to <tt>./configure</tt>,
 for each development environment you want to create on your box.
</li>
<li>I cannot find a version of the
 <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools">setuptools</a>
 available for 3.0.
 This means limiting your <tt>setup.py</tt> instructions
 to the primitive vocabulary of the <tt>distutils</tt> package.
 For example,
 I find myself unable to run the PyEphem test suite at this late hour
 because I have been running it for so long with:
 <pre>$ python setup.py test</pre>
 that I am not sure how to get it running otherwise.
</li>
<li>Should you succeed in porting your extension module,
 it is not at <i>all</i> clear how to distribute it.
 I had expected either a new PyPI to spring into being —
 since every package will need an entirely different version under 3.0 —
 or for a sophisticated scheme to appear
 for registering one <tt>pyephem.tar.gz</tt> as the Python 2 version
 and another <tt>pyephem.tar.gz</tt> for 3.0.
 But while the most recent version of your package can
 mark itself as
 <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=browse&c=214&c=527"
  >2-compatible</a> or
 <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=browse&c=214&c=533"
  >3-compatible</a> (or both)
 using classifiers,
 there is no way to have <i>two</i> “most recent” versions
 of a package.
 Are we supposed to start distributing a single <tt>tar.gz</tt>
 that includes the source code for both Python series,
 and that selects the right code by detecting the interpreter version
 at the top of the <tt>setup.py</tt> file?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So if you make the effort to port your code right now,
you might find that the shiny new version of your module
is all dressed up, but has no place to go.
If you experiment with the following steps, though,
you will at least be ready
when an official distribution channel does appear
for releasing your package into the wilds of 3.0.

<h2>Four Steps To 3.0</h2>
<p>
Yes, four steps were all that were necessary
to convert my quite complex extension module to Python 3.0!
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Use PyModule_Create().</b>
 The old mechanism that I had been using
 to initialize my extension module,
 the rather clunkily-named <tt>Py_InitModule3()</tt>,
 happily does not even exist in the Python 3.0 header files.
 Instead, call the <tt>PyModule_Create()</tt> function
 which you can find described
 in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.0/extending/extending.html#the-module-s-method-table-and-initialization-function"
  >Module Initialization</a>
 section of the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.0/extending/"
  >Extending and Embedding</a> document.
 And be sure to keep its return value:
 unlike in older Pythons,
 you now have to return the module object it creates
 as the return value from your module initialization function.
</li>
<li>
 <p>
 <b>Adjust all Python object headers.</b>
 Each type object in my code started with a macro
 to set up the common fields that all Python objects share.
 This was then followed by the <b>ob_size</b> field,
 which in my code always is always zero,
 and then the type name:
 </p>
<pre>
#!c
/* For Python 2 */

static PyTypeObject BinaryStarType = {
     PyObject_HEAD_INIT(NULL)
     0,                   /* ob_size */
     "ephem.BinaryStar",  /* tp_name */
     ...
</pre>
 <p>
 Though the Python 3.0 documentation
 <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.0/extending/newtypes.html"
  ><i>still</i> shows this as the way to create types</a>,
 this technique will now completely fail.
 (The <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue4385">bug indicating
 that the documentation gets this wrong</a> has,
 as its most recent comment,
 the helpful note
 “I'm lowering the priority so it doesn't block the release.”)
 Anyway, the solution is simple:
 the first two lines in the struct shown above
 simply have to be combined into a single macro call:
 </p>
<pre>
#!c
/* For Python 3.0 */

static PyTypeObject BinaryStarType = {
     PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT(NULL, 0)
     "ephem.BinaryStar",  /* tp_name */
     ...
</pre>
 <p>
 With this change, my objects are now operating fine.
 </p>
</li>
<li><b>Use plain “static.”</b>
 PyEphem inherits code from an era
 when it was popular to use variations on the <tt>static</tt> keyword
 so that Python could work around problems
 with various troublesome C compilers.
 This filled my code with <tt>staticforward</tt> declarations
 like the one you can see at the top of the old Python 2.2
 <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.2/ext/dnt-basics.html"
  >Defining New Types</a> page.
 It turns out that for well-behaved compilers
 these were always simply synonyms for the <tt>static</tt> keyword,
 which is what you must replace them with
 when porting your code to 3.0.
</li>
<li><b>Upgrade to Unicode.</b>
 Python 3.0 makes a clean and sharp distinction
 between strings, which are sequences of Unicode characters,
 and byte arrays, which can represent anything.
 To reflect this sea change down at the C level,
 the decision was made
 to eliminate <i>everything</i> from the C API
 whose name started with <tt>PyString</tt>.
 The obvious compiler errors that result from this
 provide a clear signal to programmers
 that they have to decide,
 everywhere that they had been using an old-style Python string,
 whether they should now represent that data
 with the <tt>PyUnicode</tt> or the <tt>PyBytes</tt> type.
 This was a brilliant decision;
 the transition could have been a nightmare
 had it remained possible for old code to compile
 without having been properly converted!
 <p>
 When migrating the PyEphem code base,
 I found that most of the Unicode transition was very easy.
 Everywhere that my code handled or created a string object,
 I simply changed the prefix of the function to <tt>PyUnicode</tt>
 and everything worked:
 </p>
 <pre>
 PyString_Check      ... becomes ... PyUnicode_Check
 PyString_FromString ... becomes ... PyUnicode_FromString
 PyString_FromFormat ... becomes ... PyUnicode_FromFormat
</pre>
 <p>
 Well, okay, the trick does not work <i>everywhere</i>;
 this one was harder to guess:
 </p>
 <pre>
 PyString_Size ... becomes ... PyUnicode_GET_SIZE
</pre>
 <p>
 The situations that require real thought
 are the places where my code needs to convert a Python string
 into the sort of simple ASCII character array
 that the underlying C library can absorb.
 At the moment, my code is leaning heavily
 on a pitiful <tt>PyUnicode_AsString()</tt> routine
 that I wrote just to get things working;
 in the morning I will have to look into doing this more correctly,
 including catching the error if a fancy Unicode character is present
 that cannot properly be converted.
 </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Overall, I am very impressed with how quickly
I was able to get my extension module compiling and running
under Python 3.0.
The procedure was simple —
I just tried, over and over again, to build the module with:
</p>
<pre>
$ python3.0 setup.py build
</pre>
<p>
and then tackled the compiler errors that resulted.
Once every last warning had been addressed,
the module started up and operated without a single further complaint.
This calls for celebration!
I'm going to bed.
