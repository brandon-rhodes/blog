# Along the eastern Tonto Trail in early May 2018

Water had been the greatest of our concerns during planning.

Through many seasons,
the Grand Canyon’s small tributary creeks are dry
between Cottonwood Creek,
where the Grandview Trail reaches the Tonto platform,
and the Corridor Trails nearly 25 long miles —
at our speed, about two and a half days —
to the west.
By conflating various internet rumors
about how much water is needed through each day hiking in the hot desert,
we had calculated that if no water were available
then we would need 22 pounds of water each
to survive the walk from the trailhead
to our arrival the Bright Angel Campground.

We were not looking forward to carrying that much weight.

You can imagine our stunned relief
when we visited the backcountry office the day before starting.
Our memorably friendly Ranger
had herself walked the East Tonto just two days before,
repairing cairns across the Cremation valleys.
She reported that not only would we find water at Cottonwood Creek
but that recent rain had brought water
to both Grapevine Creek and to Lone Tree Creek.
We would be able to refill our water at least once,
and sometimes even twice,
on every day of our hike.

She was honest that she would have advised us against our adventure —
not, I think, that we would have listened after so much preparation —
if we had planned on attempting it the previous week
when temperatures along the sun-baked East Tonto
had soared into the 90s.
But this week, she said, would be different:
cooler weather was coming;
cool weather, and possibly spring rains,
creating ideal conditions for a Canyon hike at the end of May.
Only two or three quarts of water apiece,
she said,
would probably be sufficient to see us from one creek to the next.

We were elated.

In fact, the weather would not only make our hike comfortable,
but would show us the Canyon in a stunning aspect new to all three of us.
Some of us on the tip had seen the Canyon in winter, white with snow;
and some of us had seen it in the summer under a bright clear sky.
But none of us had ever seen clouds inside the Canyon itself,
wrapping the temples and buttes in wreaths of grey and darkness,
concealing the high north and south rims.
The weather proved to be a most dynamic partner along our hike,
varying our experience of the Canyon from one day to the next
and providing us with several of the adventures would befall us along the way.

But that was all in the future as,
clutching our on which the Ranger had offered her advice,
we left the backcountry office knowing that literal weight —
12 pounds of it! —
add just been lifted from our shoulders.
Even being very cautious,
we would only need about a gallon of water capacity each.

## Logistics

We stayed at the delightful —
and delightfully inexpensive —
South Maswik Lodge while at the South Rim.
Apparently it will soon be torn down
and replaced with a more modern motel and,
lacking air conditioners,
it is said to be very uncomfortable in the summer.
But for three hikers in the cool late spring it was delightful.
Its small rooms were a nostalgic reminder
of a bygone era in American hospitality.

Our reservations provided us
with a two-night stay Saturday and Sunday nights
before the Monday start of our hike.
While we could instead have arrived up Sunday,
the extra night gave us leeway
in case someone’s flight had been late or cancelled.
We in fact all arrived on time
and so enjoyed two days of practice hikes along the rim.
Saturday featured a hike down the Kaibab Trail to Ooo-Aah Point,
and on Sunday we enjoyed leisurely walks along the South Rim,
visiting overlooks from which we began to glimpse —
thousands of feet below us —
the adventure that lay ahead.

We had reservations already
to stay at the Maswik Lodge again on Friday night
when our hike would be finished.
Once we checked out early Monday morning,
we would divide all of our luggage in two.
All of our common bags and clothing, and even our phones,
would disappear for a week into the trunk of the rental car,
there to stay locked in anticipation of our return.
Into our backpacks would go the shelter, clothing, equipment,
food, and the first installment of water
that would keep us alive through nearly 40 miles of wilderness hiking.

We thought about where to leave the car.
The Grandview trailhead,
it turns out,
is a long way from Grand Canyon Village —
far enough that it’s out of range of the Grand Canyon Village shuttle system.
If we had driven our rental car to the trailhead Monday morning,
then we would reach the South Rim again on Friday
only to find ourselves
more than 30 miles away from our first change of clothes.
After learning that taxis are available
at nearly all hours in Grand Canyon Village,
we decided instead to leave our car at the backcountry office
across the railroad tracks from the Maswik Lodge.
So an early-morning taxi deposited us at the trailhead
and on Friday afternoon, as planned,
we were reunited with the rest of our luggage
and checked back in the hotel.

## The East Tonto Trail

I should offer a brief overview
of the terrain
that I will be describing in greater detail
over each day of the hike.

The Tonto Trail runs along a vast shelf of rock,
the Tonto Platform,
that is splayed
between the cliffs reaching up to the Grand Canyon’s rim 3,700 feet above
and the sheer drop into the Colorado River's inner canyon
that cuts 1,000 feet deeper,
down into the Precambrian basement rock.
Stretching 70 miles from its western end to its easternmost extreme,
the Tonto Trail is only for short stretches
able to run parallel to the Colorado River.
Instead, to maintain a roughly consistent altitude,
it is forced to detour repeatedly — sometimes for many miles —
around the side canyons and creeks
that through the long ages have been wearing away at the south rim
and slowly opened the Canyon.

Time and fate have not allotted to each creek
an equal share in the work of carving the canyon.
Not only are they different lengths
and reach back into valleys of different sizes,
but some are so short that they don't reach the South Rim at all.
Others not only reach the rim’s edge but ramify,
throwing out vast valleys to either side of their main course
that have forever cut off their smaller competitors
from ever touching the South Rim.

A first example is visible from Grandview Point itself,
where we started our hike.
Stretching beneath you toward the north is the valley of Cottonwood Creek,
whose uppermost palisades nearly touch the South Rim itself.
To the right is the even larger valley of Hance Creek
Which has carved, not one, but two vast amphitheaters
into the edge of the South Rim
The famous “Sinking Ship” formation founders between them.

You might therefore think that a rafter traveling the Colorado
wood see only two great gashes in the south wall of the inner canyon,
bringing Hance Creek and Cottonwood Creek into the river.
But, in fact, they would also see a third:
in between those two great valleys
is a tiny drainage that my map does not even name.
Over the long eons during which the great Creeks
have carved many miles south into the Kaibab Plateau,
this smaller drainage has only managed to cut
a few thousand feet back from the Colorado River's edge
into the spur of land between the other two creeks.
This tiny amphitheatre —
its own small contribution to the art of carving the Canyon —
is what has given the tall mesa above it its name:
Horseshoe Mesa,
which is left with two thin arms
reaching out along either side of the unnamed drainage
in the famous shape of a horseshoe.

This pattern of very large drainages
interspersed with very modest ones
continues west along the entire section of Tonto platform that we walked.
Cottonwood Creek —
which, you will remember, almost cuts all the way back to the rim —
is followed by the vast Grapevine Creek valley
whose inner canyon has never been forgotten by any hiker of the Eastern Tonto.
Cutting back towards the South Rim,
Grapevine has branches into no fewer than five subordinate valleys
before reaching the sheer edge
where they slowly erode the South Rim itself.
It is the large volume of water this branching valley system can collect
that provides the Eastern Tonto with the deepest of its side Canyons.

Heading west from Grapevine,
there is a small unnamed drainage
whose tiny amphitheatre appears on my map
as only a dent at the end of Lyell Butte;
then the wide bowl carved by the more ambitious Boulder Creek;
two more small drainages,
mere notches in the edge of the inner canyon;
and then the even smaller Lone Tree Canyon.

Finally, out west of Lone Tree,
are the prodigious Cremation creeks
which are only rivaled on this section of the Tonto Platform
by Grapevine Canyon itself.
While Cremation is unusually dry, even for the South Tonto —
the National Park’s literature describes it flatly as “Dry all year” —
it nevertheless controls an impressively large drainage.
The upper edges of its eastern two valleys are the South Rim itself,
reaching far up at Shoshone point
that it touches the Western arm of Grapevine itself

Only two drainages, then, truly dominate the south Canyon
between Grandview Point and the Kaibab trailhead at Yaki Point.
Between those two points,
Creamation Creek and Grapevine Creek are the two partners
that together are cutting away at the South Rim
as one eon follows another.
