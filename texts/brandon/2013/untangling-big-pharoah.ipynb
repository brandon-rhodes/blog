    "combined with a swipe at the United States\n",

    "I draw three lessons about information visualization from the fact\n",
    "that a diagram whose politics are so simplistic\n",
    "has been re-blogged as evidence that the Middle East is complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the diagram presents a puzzle\n",
    "for which the human vision is simply not optimized.\n",
    "Never, to my knowledge, does Nature present a hunter-gatherer\n",
    "with a web of different-colored links\n",
    "and demand a quick intuition\n",
    "about whether the nodes form only a few basic groupings\n",
    "or are hopelessly splintered into several.\n",
    "So presenting the information this way\n",
    "makes it basically opaque.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, our eyes are very sensitive\n",
    "to similarities between shapes,\n",
    "yet the diagram takes a uniform relationship like “supports”\n",
    "and splays it across the page at a half-dozen different\n",
    "angles and sizes to create a perception of chaos.\n",
    "The fact that the arrows are hand-drawn\n",
    "adds an extra level of visual noise\n",
    "that is simply icing on the cake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, edge-coloring turns out to be a fairly expensive way\n",
    "to illustrate nodes that fall into a few groups,\n",
    "because in the general case you wind up drawing $n^2$ edges\n",
    "when instead you could just use 3 or 4 colors\n",
    "to label broad groups\n",
    "and then explain the relationships among them.\n",
    "You could even use a mix of node-colorings and edges:\n",
    "imagine a map of the 30 Years’ War\n",
    "that colors Catholic countries one color,\n",
    "Protestant countries another,\n",
    "and then has a few annotations thrown in\n",
    "to explain the exceptions to those natural allegances\n",
    "that arose during the protracted conflict.\n",
    "I suspect that the same approach would work better here."
