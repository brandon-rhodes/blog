<p>
  The September issue of Python Magazine
  appeared on the web late last week
  and only now, as a new week has started,
  am I finally sitting down to announce it!
  The articles range from technically heavy development topics
  to high-level thoughts about the whole Python community,
  with plenty in between.
</p>
<p>
  I have to say that our prettiest article this month
  is “Using Python to Create Beautiful Documents” by Yusdi Santoso,
  who shares the basic secrets to document generation
  that he learned when building the
  <a href="http://www.europython.eu/">EuroPython 2009</a> brochure
  using a Python program.
  Traditional typesetting and computer typography
  were both interests of mine when I was growing up,
  so it was fun to read Yusdi's introduction to using
  <a href="http://www.reportlab.org/">ReportLab</a>
  to generate PDF documents.
  I look forward to his follow-up article
  that we will soon be publishing,
  on the specific techniques that he used in creating
  the EuroPython booklet.
</p>
<p>
  The other technical articles are an introduction
  to using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/">SOAP</a> in Python;
  a guide to displaying objects in a Mac OS X GUI created with PyObjC;
  an article introducing Python's own built-in
  <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/tkinter.html">Tkinter</a>
  GUI toolkit;
  and a small excursion of my own
  that attempts to explain the popular “trick”
  (well, it really confused <i>me</i> the first time I saw it!)
  of defining a decorator using a pair of nested functions.
  I should confess that my own article
  contains what is probably this issue's biggest mistake,
  as pointed out quite promptly by alert reader Emanuel Woiski:
  in the code sample that is its whole crux of my example,
  I somehow managed to omit one of the most crucial lines,
  shown here in bold:
</p>
<pre>
def log(function):
    def log_wrapper(*args):
        print "called %s%s" % (
            function.__name__, tuple(args)
            )
        <b>return function(*args)</b>
    return log_wrapper
</pre>
<p>
  I suppose I will now need remedial cut-and-paste training of some sort.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the issue is rounded out
  by three articles that move back from Python coding
  and step out to wider vantage points.
  Justin Lilly provides an excellent guide
  to customizing your Vim setup
  so that it becomes a powerful Python
  integrated development environment.
  Steve Holden muses about why diveristy is so difficult
  and reveals some of the recent goings-on
  surrounding the diversity statement
  that the Python Software Foundation has been working on.
  And my own editorial seeks to point any Python Magazine readers
  who do not yet have a strong connection with the wider community
  in the direction of greater engagement
  with the world of Python.
</p>
<p>
  All in all, I think the issue
  is a nice mix of fact, experience, and opinion.
  Please consider subscribing if you would like to hear more
  about what people are doing with Python, and how.
  I enjoy reading it; so might you.
