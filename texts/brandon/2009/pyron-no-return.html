title: 'pyron: Making Python package development DRY to the point of no return'
---
<p>
  I finally snapped last week.
</p>
<p>
  After years of writing verbose and repetitive <tt>setup.py</tt> files
  for my Python packages,
  I am unable to write another.
  Instead, I have started writing
  <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyron/"
     >Pyron</a>,
  a tool that gathers the same information
  by inspecting a Python package itself.
  Not only does this mean that I get to
  <b>stop repeating myself</b>,
  but that my projects will become much more uniform
  because package metadata will be represented through
  <b>common conventions</b> instead of explicit (and repetitive) configuration.
  Though Pyron is still very primitive,
  it has already allowed me to reduce simple packages
  to only a <tt>README.txt</tt> plus their actual Python source code.
</p>

<h2>The start of the trouble</h2>
<p>
  What happened is that I wanted to create a simple Python package
  full of tools for professional authors
  working with <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">rst</a>
  documents, so that they could monitor their word count while writing,
  and convert their <i>rst</i> files into the proprietary formats
  used by various publications.
  But just to start a new Python project
  required me to create <i>four</i> entire files,
  and almost as many directories:
</p>
<pre>
./cursive.tools/setup.py
./cursive.tools/cursive/__init__.py
./cursive.tools/cursive/tools/README.txt
./cursive.tools/cursive/tools/__init__.py
</pre>
<p>
  The <tt>setup.py</tt> file itself
  repeats the project name over, and over, and over again,
  reminding me of the old Adventure game's
  “maze of twisty passages, all alike”:
</p>
<pre>
#!python
from setuptools import setup
setup(
    name = 'cursive.tools',
    version = '0.1',
    description = 'Tools for restructured text files',
    author = 'Brandon Craig Rhodes',
    author_email = 'brandon@rhodesmill.org',
    packages = ['cursive.tools', 'cursive'],
    namespace_packages = ['cursive'],
    )
</pre>
<p>
  The first <tt>__init__.py</tt> file shown above of course looks like:
</p>
<pre>
#!python
  import pkg_resources
  pkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__)
</pre>
<p>
  Meanwhile, my stub <tt>README.txt</tt> and <tt>__init__.py</tt> files
  down in the bottom directory contained just enough information to get
  me started, whether I wanted to start by writing documentation and
  tests or get started by writing actual code:
</p>
<pre>
``cursive.tools`` -- Tools for restructured text files
------------------------------------------------------

The routines in this ``cursive.tools`` package are
designed for authors.  They provide command-line tools
that can examine Restructured Text files.
</pre>
<pre>
"""Command-line routines for Restructured Text authors."""

__version__ = '0.1'
</pre>
<p>
  And, having created these files, I stopped, and stared in horror.
</p>
<p>
  For an <i>entire hour</i> I tried to move on.
  I tried to start writing actual code and actual documentation.
  I tried to just ignore the stupidity of what I had just written.
  Or, in the case of <tt>setup.py</tt>, what I had just
  written by cutting and pasting
  from another project on my hard drive —
  yes, it's actually become <i>that bad</i>,
  that we cut-and-paste file contents between Python projects
  because our boilerplate requires so much repetition
  while carrying so little information.
</p>
<p>
  But, try though I might, I could not move on to writing code;
  I was finally defeated.
  The Python language has done such a wonderful job over the past decade
  of honing my asthetics and sharpening my senses
  that I am now unable to use its own standard packaging techquies!
  This new package would have to wait
  until I had resolved the problems
  that sat staring me in the face.
  Let us review them, one by one.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    After stating so carefully
    that this package was named <tt>cursive.tools</tt>,
    I then had to inform <tt>setup()</tt>
    that the project <tt>name</tt> would also be —
    who would have guessed? —
    <tt>cursive.tools</tt> as well!
    This is idiotic.
    <i>Of course</i> I am giving this project the same name
    as the package it contains;
    that is a best-practice from which modern Python projects
    have no excuse to dissent.
    Who wants to have to remember
    that you need the <tt>ZODB3</tt> package
    when all you want to do is import <tt>persistent</tt>?
    Who wants to remember to depend on <tt>pyephem</tt>
    when all you want is to import <tt>ephem</tt>
    (a problem that I, myself, created
    in my own misguided Python youth)?
    Not me.
    And not, if they have any sense, my users.
  </li>
  <li>
    This package is named <tt>cursive.tools</tt>.
    <i>Of course</i> I want <tt>cursive</tt> to be a namespace package!
    That is so painfully obvious that it should not even require mention;
    it should be inferred.
  </li>
  <li>
    Similarly, the mention that <tt>cursive</tt> is a package
    in the <tt>packages</tt> declaration is redundant.
    <i>Of course</i> if <tt>a.b</tt> is a package
    then <tt>a</tt> is going to be a package as well!
    There's not even a way to avoid that in the Python language,
    so far as I know.
    Why even make me type it?
  </li>
  <li>
    The entire top-level <tt>__init__.py</tt> file —
    the one inside of the <tt>cursive</tt> directory —
    is <i>utterly and entirely</i> a boilerplate cut-and-paste.
    Given that <tt>cursive</tt> is already stated
    to be a namespace package,
    it should not even be necessary to provide the contents
    of its <tt>__init__.py</tt>;
    it's standard
    and can be copied straight from
    <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0382/">PEP-382</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The package, you will note, has started out lacking
    a <tt>long_description</tt>
    despite the fact
    that it has a perfectly serviceable <tt>README.txt</tt> file.
    Many packages jump through the hoops of path manipulation
    just to find their own <tt>README.txt</tt>
    so that they can include it as their long description;
    but why, in the absence of an override,
    shouldn't its inclusion as the long description be the default?
  </li>
  <li>
    This raises the larger question of where, exactly,
    should a project <tt>README.txt</tt> even go —
    where on the filesystem, that is, should it be placed?
    There seems to be no consistency on this
    between different Python packages.
    Some people place it directly at the project top-level,
    next to the <tt>setup.py</tt> file,
    which is friendliest to developers
    checking out the source code from a public repository —
    but which makes the <tt>README.txt</tt> invisible
    to users!
    Others place it down inside of the package directory itself
    so that it will be included in their distribution,
    which is better;
    and still other Python projects
    have <i>two</i> separate <tt>README.txt</tt> files
    so that they have both bases covered!
  </li>
  <li>
    The package version is kept in two different places here:
    in the <tt>setup.py</tt> and also in the <tt>__version__</tt>
    symbol of the module itself.
    When the version advances,
    both places will have to be updated —
    if the developer remembers!
    The alternative is for the <tt>setup.py</tt> to grow
    more complex by including its own bootstrap code
    that uses path manipulations
    to find and introspect the <tt>__version__</tt> symbol
    inside of the module.
  </li>
  <li>
    The name of the package occurs
    both at the top of <tt>README.txt</tt>
    and inside of <tt>setup.py</tt>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The short description is repeated twice:
    once in the title of the <tt>README.txt</tt>
    and once in the <tt>setup()</tt> stanza of the <tt>setup.py</tt>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, the directory structure of this project is ridiculous.
    If, as the <tt>setup.py</tt> clearly states,
    I am writing the <tt>cursive.tools</tt> module,
    why should I even include both a <tt>cursive</tt>
    and a <tt>tools</tt> directory?
    Since the <i>only legitimate activity</i>
    that I can undertake in constructing this module
    is to place files <i>inside</i> of <tt>cursive.tools</tt>,
    why do directories exist where files could collect outside
    of this one depository?
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Obviously,
  the above arguments hold only for pure-Python packages;
  when C extensions and other special effects come into play,
  then excellent reasons arise for a complicated directory structure,
  sophisticated metadata,
  and possibly documentation above and beyond that distributed
  with binary versions of the package.
  But for normal packages,
  I am finished with writing and distributing a <tt>setup.py</tt>
  by hand.

<h2>Toward perfecting Pyron</h2>
<p>
  My new tool for Python package building,
  <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyron"
     >Pyron</a> —
  which, for those keeping score, is my very first
  <a href="http://bitbucket.org/brandon/pyron/"
     >bitbucket-hosted project</a>
  (and I am very much enjoying these first few weeks of using Mercurial,
  since Guido made the
  <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2009-March/087931.html"
     >big decision</a> at the end of PyCon last month) —
  is not yet mature enough to warrant a first release on PyPI.
  Please check out the development version
  if you want to take a first look at Pyron.
  And, yes, Pyron currently has to include a <tt>setup.py</tt>
  of its own,
  which will not disappear until I release the first version
  and it can become self-hosting!
</p>
<p>
  Please note that Pyron is <i>only</i> for developers!
  The <tt>sdist</tt> archives and the eggs produced
  for a Pyron-powered project
  are completely standard;
  the end users and developers installing a module
  will not be affected by your choice to use Pyron.
  It simply keeps your project repository cleaner
  by inferring package metadata on the fly
  rather than making you maintain a <tt>setup.py</tt>
  in version control along with your Python package.
</p>
<p>
  A package developed with <tt>pyron</tt>
  only needs two files:
  <tt>README.txt</tt> and <tt>__init__.py</tt>.
  The two files quoted above will work just fine.
  These simply need to sit in the same directory,
  like this:
</p>
<pre>
./cursive.tools/README.txt
./cursive.tools/__init__.py
</pre>
<p>
  See?
  All of the actual meat of the <tt>cursive.tools</tt> module
  remains when the files are stored like this,
  while the while repetition and boilerplate disappears!
  Check out the Pyron <tt>README.txt</tt>
  (or, of course, the same information as formatted in its
  <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyron/"
     >project page on PyPI</a>)
  for more details about how it works;
  here, I will just make three last observations:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Sometimes I had to choose between best practices
    when deciding how Pyron would operate.
    Where, for example, should it find the package name?
    Instead of looking at the title of the <tt>README.txt</tt>,
    as it currently does,
    one could imagine my having written it
    to look somewhere in <tt>__init__.py</tt>
    (but there seems to be no agreed-upon place
    for a package to name itself),
    or even at the name of the directory
    in which the package is sitting
    (but often the directory will not be named <tt>cursive.tools</tt>,
    but something like <tt>branches/0.1</tt>
    or even just <tt>trunk</tt>).
    In each case,
    I have tried to choose the most obvious
    and easy-to-maintain convention,
    and the real point is that there be <i>some</i> common idiom
    for everyone to fall into line with
    as more and more packages in the future
    abandon their <tt>setup.py</tt> files
    and start using Pyron.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sometimes no best practice existed,
    and I had to, frankly, make things up.
    Where should the author of a package go,
    without a <tt>setup.py</tt> file?
    In a special metadata file that I would have to invent?
    In some formatted region of the <tt>README.txt</tt> file?
    By choosing instead that it go
    inside an <tt>__author__</tt> symbol in <tt>setup.py</tt>,
    I hope that I have at least preserved symmetry
    with an existing best-practice
    while, again, making future Python projects as readable as possible
    should Pyron use become widespread.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pyron should become more sophisticated in the future,
    and eliminate even more repitition.
    It currently needs project dependencies,
    for example,
    to be defined as a <tt>__requires__</tt> constant
    in a package's <tt>__init__.py</tt> file.
    In the future,
    Pyron will hopefully gain the ability
    to inspect a project's <tt>import</tt> statements
    and make intelligent guesses about its dependencies
    that could often eliminate any need
    for explicit dependency declarations.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Thanks to Pyron,
  I am now happily working away on my <tt>cursive</tt> packages,
  and they should soon see their first releases.
  I can now sleep at night,
  knowing that boilerplate and repetition
  have finally vanished from my development code.
</p>
