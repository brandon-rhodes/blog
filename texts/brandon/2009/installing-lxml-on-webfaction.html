title: Installing lxml for Python under your WebFaction account
---
<p>
  Well, drat.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks to more than an hour of work today,
  I have a pretty list of a few dozen commands
  that make it easy for a WebFaction account holder
  to install the powerful
  <a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/">lxml</a> Python package
  for parsing HTML and XML under their hosting account.
  You can read Ian Bicking's wonderful blog post
  <a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/2008/12/10/lxml-an-underappreciated-web-scraping-library/"
     >“lxml: an underappreciated web scraping library”</a>
  for more information on why you want to be using lxml
  instead of any of its alternatives.
</p>
<p>
  So, why do I say “drat”?
</p>
<p>
  First,
  because I just tried out my instructions on another
  of my WebFaction accounts,
  and there the extra steps weren't even necessary;
  this other server of theirs
  already had lxml's dependencies installed!
  I suppose, had I been a bit more patient, that
  <a href="http://forum.webfaction.com/viewtopic.php?id=2695"
     >this support ticket that I glanced over this morning</a>
  would have inspired me to ask WebFaction
  to install the libraries lxml needs
  on the server where I myself was working.
  But it felt like some sort of offense against symmetry
  to rely on something that WebFaction doesn't install everywhere,
  and I was perhaps just in too big of a hurry.
  Which, of course, cost more time in the end.
</p>
<p>
  The other reason I say “drat” is because,
  now that I look at Ian's post again after all these months,
  I see that he has instructions for making the package
  install its own dratted copies of the system libraries it needs!
  Too bad that
  <a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/installation.html"
     >lxml's own installation instructions</a>
  omit this crucial piece of information.
</p>
<p>
  How typical, and how predictable.
  It turns out that I just needed to listen to Ian Bicking more carefully.
  How often we fail to do that,
  as individuals and as a Python community.
  Listen to Ian Bicking, everyone.
  Listen.

  In the meantime,
  here are some successful and unsuccessful ways
  of installing lxml under your WebFaction account.
  Consider the following to be a set of choose-your-own adventure
  scenarios.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      If the WebFaction host your account lives on
      <b>already has libxml and libxslt installed</b>,
      then installation is simple:
    </p>
    <pre
>$ easy_install lxml
Searching for lxml
Reading http://pypi.python.org/simple/lxml/
...
<b>Finished processing dependencies for lxml</b>
</pre>
  <li>
    <p>
      If your WebFaction host <b>lacks libxml</b>,
      but you <b>listen to Ian Bicking</b>
      and <b>download the source code yourself</b>,
      then your install will succeed:
    </p>
    <pre
>$ wget <a href="http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/l/lxml/lxml-2.2.2.tar.gz"
          >http://pypi.python.org/.../lxml-2.2.2.tar.gz</a>
$ tar xfz lxml-2.2.2.tar.gz
$ cd lxml-2.2.2
$ STATIC_DEPS=true python setup.py install
...
<b>Finished processing dependencies for lxml==2.2.2</b></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If your WebFaction host <b>lacks libxml</b>,
      but you <b>listen to Ian Bicking</b>,
      but you <b>rely on easy_install to fetch the package</b>,
      then your install will <b>fail</b>
      because it tries building inside of a temporary directory
      that, on WebFaction, you apparently cannot access:
    </p>
    <pre
>$ STATIC_DEPS=true easy_install lxml
Searching for lxml
Reading http://pypi.python.org/simple/lxml/
...
Running "./configure --without-python --disable-dependency-tracking
 --disable-shared --prefix=/tmp/easy_install-81ufo5/lxml-2.2.2/buil
d/tmp/libxml2" in build/tmp/libxml2-2.7.3
<b>error: Permission denied</b></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If your WebFaction host <b>lacks libxml</b>,
      and you <b>fail to listen to Ian Bicking</b>,
      then you can at least install lxml and its dependencies manually
      using the following commands,
      as I worked out this morning.
      The trick is that instead of trying to tell <tt>setup.py</tt>
      where you have installed the libraries
      by using <tt>CC=</tt> at the beginning of the command line
      or something like that,
      you need to make sure that the special command <tt>xslt-config</tt>
      is on your path somewhere:
    </p>
    <pre
>$ cd ~
$ mkdir usr
$ mkdir usr/src
$ cd usr/src
$ wget <a href="ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/libxml2-2.7.3.tar.gz"
           >ftp://xmlsoft.org/.../libxml2-2.7.3.tar.gz</a>
$ wget <a href="ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/libxslt-1.1.24.tar.gz"
          >ftp://xmlsoft.org/.../libxslt-1.1.24.tar.gz</a>
$ tar xfz libxml2-2.7.3.tar.gz
$ tar xfz libxslt-1.1.24.tar.gz
$ cd libxml2-2.7.3
$ ./configure --prefix ~/usr
$ make install
$ cd ..
$ cd libxslt-1.1.24
$ ./configure --prefix ~/usr
$ make install
$ cd ..
$ PATH=$HOME/usr/bin:$PATH
$ wget <a href="http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/l/lxml/lxml-2.2.2.tar.gz"
          >http://pypi.python.org/.../lxml-2.2.2.tar.gz</a>
$ tar xfz lxml-2.2.2.tar.gz
$ cd lxml-2.2.2
$ python setup.py install
...
<b>Finished processing dependencies for lxml==2.2.2</b></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  But, as I mentioned, Ian's technique is faster. :-)
