title: The terrible magic of setuptools
---
<p>
  I am providing a bit of assistance to the wonderful
  <a href="http://www.nltk.org/">Natural Language Toolkit</a> Project,
  who have implemented a wide array
  of language processing algorithms in Python
  atop a common set of very sleek — and cleanly Pythonic —
  data structures for representing natural language.
  If you are at all interested,
  check out their recent book,
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596516495?ie=UTF8&tag=letsdisthemat-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596516495">Natural Language Processing with Python,</a><img class="inline" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=letsdisthemat-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596516495" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
  which does a great job of showing how the NLTK works
  at the same time as it explains
  the computer science concepts of language processing.
</p>
<p>
  The NTLK project wants to support
  installing their package as a Python egg,
  so they asked me to tidy up their <tt>setup.py</tt> file
  and prepare everything for distribution via the Python Package Index.
</p>
<p>
  As usual,
  my desire for simple and reproducible behavior
  when distributing Python packages
  has run aground on the tangled magic
  for which <tt>setuptools</tt> is so justly famous.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
  The NLTK package's original <tt>setup.py</tt>,
  powered by the standard <tt>distutils</tt>,
  produced a tidy source <tt>tar.gz</tt> of around 850 KB.
  My fancy egg-capable version, on the other hand, wound up disgorging
  a source archive of no less than 24.7 MB in size.
  The NLTK people added a note to our open issue that
  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nltk/issues/detail?id=56"
     >politely asked me why their source distribution
  was now thirty times its original size</a>
  without the package's <tt>MANIFEST.in</tt>
  file having been changed in the least.
</p>
<p>
  I recognized the problem immediately, of course,
  as will many of you who have transitioned a project
  from the <tt>distutils</tt> to <tt>setuptools</tt> before.
  In order to make our lives so vastly grand and convenient,
  <tt>setuptools</tt> includes in a source distribution
  not only all of the files described in the package's manifest,
  but also every file in the area
  that is currently checked into Subversion!
  This introduces a thicket of potential problems:
  a project started without version control
  will suddenly behave differently when checked into Subversion;
  files disappear from the source distribution
  if you upgrade from Subversion to a version control system
  of which <tt>setuptools</tt> is ignorant;
  and, of course,
  any attempt to build your project
  from a clean <tt>svn</tt> <tt>export</tt>
  can result in a source archive with hundreds of files missing.
</p>
<p>
  Since the NLTK has been distributed successfully for years
  using only <tt>distutils</tt> and a well-written project manifest,
  I simply wanted to turn off the magic.
  It would be possible, I suppose,
  to instruct packagers to run <tt>svn</tt> <tt>export</tt>
  before running the <tt>sdist</tt> command,
  but it offends good sense
  that you should have to check out a project
  in some special way just to get predictable behavior.
  The whole point of version control
  is that it's supposed to be <i>meta</i>-data
  that keeps up with history while having <i>no effect</i>
  on how an application builds and runs.
</p>
<p>
  Having been bitten by this <tt>setuptools</tt> feature
  several times in the past,
  I decided that, this time,
  I would actually learn how to disable the behavior
  instead of trying to work around it yet again.
  “Where,” I thought, “is the switch?
  Where is the option?”
  After an exhausting search of the
  <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools"
     >setuptools documentation</a>
  and then, finally, its source code,
  I am perplexed to report
  that the only recourse left to us seems to be violence!
  You must actually damage <tt>setuptools</tt>
  before running the <tt>setup()</tt> function
  if you want to prevent it from trying to muck about with Subversion.
  The cleanest attack on the problem —
  or should we say the “cleanest surgery?” —
  seems to be:
</p>
<pre>
#!python
# Add this to setup.py before you call setup()

from setuptools.command import sdist
del sdist.finders[:]
</pre>
<p>
  With this change,
  <tt>setuptools</tt> peacefully ignores
  whether the project
  happens to have been checked out of version control or not,
  and with a bit of tweaking
  the same source distribution can be produced
  as would have been generated by the <tt>distutils</tt>.
</p>
<p>
  Now, at this point, you probably think that this blog post
  is shaping up to be a complaint against how <tt>setuptools</tt>
  pays attention to Subversion
  while providing no way to turn this intrusive feature off.
  But, in fact, that is all really just a side issue:
  it was a minor adventure that I wanted to share
  on the way toward my main point.
  I am not even sure whether the remedy suggested above
  is a good idea;
  I have
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1129180/how-can-i-make-setuptools-ignore-subversion-inventory"
     >asked the question on Stack Overflow</a>,
  so we can see if someone else figures out a better approach.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>actual</i> complaint of this blog post
  is that <tt>setuptools</tt> displays
  a troublesome, undocumented, and downright obfuscatory hysteresis
  with respect to the list of files
  that gets included in a source package.
  The fact is, after I discovered
  the <tt>sdist.finders</tt> trick quoted above,
  <i>I actually thought it didn't work
    because the next source archive I created
    was exactly the same size as before</i>.
</p>
<p>
  The problem?
  It turns out that <tt>setuptools</tt>
  will choose to keep including a given file in your source archive,
  <i>even if you have removed it from your manifest</i>,
  until you force <tt>setuptools</tt>
  to rebuild the package's file list
  by destroying its <tt>SOURCES.txt</tt> file:
</p>
<pre>
$ python setup.py sdist
$ wc -c dist/nltk-2.0b4.tar.gz
25648109
$ rm nltk.egg-info/SOURCES.txt
$ python setup.py sdist
$ wc -c dist/nltk-2.0b4.tar.gz
868517
</pre>
<p>
  Only with this removal will files
  that are no longer listed in the manifest,
  or governed by version control,
  quietly and finally drop out of the source archives
  you are creating.
  That is my complaint:
  that <tt>setuptools</tt> refuses to remove files
  from your source distribution
  unless you know to go remove a magic file from under its nose.
</p>
<p>
  As I now go to close out that NLTK ticket,
  should I explain that packagers
  always need to manually remove <tt>SOURCES.txt</tt>
  before preparing an official source distribution
  for upload to the Python Package Index?
  Or should I be brave
  and add an <tt>os.remove()</tt> call to <tt>setup.py</tt> myself
  that always destroys the file
  before the <tt>setup()</tt> call gets underway?
  Is there any danger to that approach?
  Leave a comment and let me know!
