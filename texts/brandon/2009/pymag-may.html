title: The May 2009 issue of Python Magazine
---
<p>
  The May issue of Python Magazine is now online!
  Obviously things fell a bit behind schedule this month,
  as I am writing this five days into the month of June.
  But with all of the excitement surrounding the publisher's
  flagship annual conference last month —
  php|tek 2009 in Chicago —
  it was certainly better that the magazine slip late
  than that delays interfere with an event
  which drew a couple of hundred people
  to learn more about quality software development.

  What can you look forward to reading?
  This issue worked out as a balance between community news
  and several sophisticated technical articles
  on using Python better.
  The technical articles include:
</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
  <li>
    A tutorial on how to customize sorting under Python 3
    if you had been in the habit of using the <tt>cmp</tt> parameter
    under previous versions of Python.
  </li>
  <li>
    A guide to using <tt>repoze.who</tt> and <tt>repoze.what</tt>
    in your WSGI application stack to secure your web site.
  </li>
  <li>
    An introduction to programming graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
    using the popular PyGTK module,
    in our regular “Welcome to Python” column.
  </li>
  <li>
    And, finally, a guide to how basic Python types are transformed
    when you use PyObjC to build applications on your Mac.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Balancing these highly technical articles
  are three features focused on the Python community.
  Catherine Devlin writes about running
  <a href="http://www.pyohio.org/">the PyOhio conference</a> last year,
  an event which will happen again this July.
  Steve Holden offers thoughts on the economic downturn and Python.
  And, finally, I cap it all off with a rousing editorial
  urging celebration now that Guido is “tiring”, if not “retiring”,
  from Python — as he announced at this year's PyCon —
  since this signals that Python is now complete
  and can be confidently built upon
  as a stable platform for permanent application development.

  As usual, I hope you will consider a subscription,
  which will not only give you immediate access
  to the current issue online,
  but can also provide you with printed copies of future issues
  that you can leave on the breakroom table at work
  or on the coffee table of a friend.
  Use the magazine to show the skeptical that Python is not a toy,
  but a professional language that attracts the very best
  in talent, in software development practices, and in community.
  Enjoy!
