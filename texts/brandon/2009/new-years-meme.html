title: 'New Year&#039;s meme: What are the oldest files in your home directory?'
---
<p>
Celebrate the new year with a blog post
discussing the oldest files
that are still sitting somewhere beneath your home directory!
The procedure is simple:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the following script in your home directory.
(You might want to use <i>less</i> to read the output.)</li>
<li>Ignore files whose date does not reflect your own activity.</li>
<li>List the oldest files in a blog post and discuss!</li>
</ol>
<pre>
#!python
#!/usr/bin/env python
"""Print last-modified times of files beneath '.', oldest first."""
import os, os.path, time
paths = ( os.path.join(b,f) for (b,ds,fs) in os.walk('.') for f in fs )
for mtime, path in sorted( (os.lstat(p).st_mtime, p) for p in paths ):
    print time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d", time.localtime(mtime)), path
</pre>
<p>
Only include files whose last-modified time
is a date on which you really touched the file.
The file's time should neither result from an error
(a few files beneath my own home directory
have an incorrect date of 1970-01-01),
nor from unpacking someone else's archive
that has old files inside of it.
For example,
I myself have excluded
the following pair of nearly 17-year-old files
because their dates reflect their age
inside of the Python 3.0 source archive,
instead of the actual moment last month
when they became part of my home directory:
</p>
<pre>
1992-03-02 ./src/Python-3.0/Demo/scripts/wh.py
1992-03-02 ./src/Python-3.0/Tools/scripts/dutree.doc
</pre>
<p>
But there is no requirement that the actual <i>content</i>
of each file you list be your own.
Whether you wrote the file yourself long ago,
or downloaded it from some ancient and forgotten FTP site,
you have a story to share!
</p>
<p>
Within the rules given above,
here are the oldest files beneath my own home directory:
</p>
<!--more-->
<pre>
# My oldest five files!
# (The links return their content.)

1989-05-17 ./archive/unixpc/cee/crobots/<a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/static/2009/BCRMAD.R.txt">BCRMAD.R</a>
1989-05-17 ./archive/unixpc/cee/crobots/<a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/static/2009/BCRONE.R.txt">BCRONE.R</a>
1990-01-18 ./archive/unixpc/ref/<a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/static/2009/train">train.gz</a>
1990-01-18 ./archive/unixpc/ref/<a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/static/2009/xmas">xmas.gz</a>
1990-05-18 ./archive/unixpc/save/Rhodes/<a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/static/2009/treasure">treasure</a>
</pre>
<p>
You can see that these files were moved, long ago,
into an archive directory for files
that are no longer part of an active project.
These files all date from the era
when my home directory was hosted
on the <span class="sc">Unix</span> PC which my father,
a Bell Laboratories engineer,
brought home in the 1980s as our personal computer.
</p>
<p>
We should start with the zipped files from January 1990,
since they actually contain even older content,
from December 1987 —more than twenty years ago!
My father received them as Christmas greetings
from fellow engineers at the Labs.
You can view
<tt><a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/static/2009/xmas">xmas</a></tt>
right in your browser,
since it is a simple ASCII-art holiday greeting
(the name “Merrimack Valley” at the bottom
refers to the particular Bell Labs location
at which my father worked).
Viewing
<tt><a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/static/2009/train">train</a></tt>
is more difficult, since it contains a VT-100 animation
that will display much too quickly
if you dump the file to a modern terminal.
Instead, download the file and use this Python program
to display it at a more traditional speed;
you might want to light a candle and play some Christmas music
while the animation is displaying:
</p>
<pre>
#!python
#!/usr/bin/env python
"""Display the 'train' file, slowly."""
import sys, time
for c in open('train').read():
    sys.stdout.write(c)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    time.sleep(1.0/9600.0) # (drat, really sleeps 0.01s)
</pre>
<p>
Though Dad probably retained the files only through the Christmas season,
I was fascinated by watching them
scroll silently across the black screen
in glowing, green, phosphoric characters
that seemed to leave trails behind them like shooting stars,
and so I kept the files
long after many subsequent Christmases had come and gone.
</p>
<p>
The other three files are all plain-text files,
and are all of my own making.
The <tt><a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/static/2009/BCRMAD.R.txt">BCRMAD.R</a></tt>
and <tt><a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/static/2009/BCRONE.R.txt">BCRONE.R</a></tt>
programs were experiments in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crobots">the old
<span class="sc">crobots</span> game</a>,
where you wrote small C-language programs
to control robots that drove around on the screen
and shot at each other.
The names seem to refer to the fact
that the first file simulates a “mad bull”
that drives straight at targets
shooting as fast as it can,
while the second program always takes “one shot” at a target
then flees to another location on the screen.
This would have been one of my very first forays into C programming —
perhaps my very first —
and so the algorithms are, I must admit,
not exactly pinnacles of sophistication.
</p>
<p>
The last file is named
<tt><a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/static/2009/treasure">treasure</a></tt>,
and it is, indeed, a real treasure of a file
to have discovered this New Year's morning!
It is my long-lost account,
carefully annotated with the venerable <tt>mm</tt> macro package
(as you can see from the <i>troff</i> include directive
on the first line),
of the day in early 1990
when I discovered buried treasure
that my father had hidden as a child on my grandparent's property!
I actually saw the “treasure” last week
(an ancient coffee can with old toys inside)
sitting on a shelf when I visited my grandmother on Christmas Day.
I will have to pull it down from the shelf
and put some pictures on Flickr, along with excerpts
from this long-lost story of its discovery!
</p>
<p>
In the meantime: what are the oldest files under <i>your</i>
home directory?
