<p class="note">
  A conference lasts only a few days.
  But when organizers are able to record the talks and keynotes,
  the event can impact hundreds more people
  who were not able to attend.
  Here are some of my own efforts to get up on stage
  and share what I have learned
  with the communities that have given me so much!

    Warsaw was the perfect venue
    for reflecting on how Mikołaj Kopernik —
    the Polish astronomer who published in Latin as “Copernicus” —
    faced the perennial problem of refactoring,
    when he saw redundant code repeated all through
    Ptolemy's model of the solar system.

  <h2>The Naming of Ducks: Where Dynamic Types Meet Smart Conventions</h2>

    Continuing where my PyCon Canada talk left off,
    I explore several common practices for choosing names wisely
    when writing Python code
    — and suggest that apt names are the lifeline
    that keep programmers afloat in dynamic languages.

  <h2>A Python Æsthetic: Beauty and Why I Python</h2>
  <p>
    PyCon Canada 2012<br>
    Toronto, Ontario<br>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kB2o8sd5c">video</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    This was my very first experience with being an invited speaker,
    where I could choose any topic I wanted
    instead of having to submit a competitive proposal.
    I wanted to use this opportunity by filling the talk
    with the kind of miscellaneous, practical coding advice
    that so rarely fits the agenda of a more serious proposal.
    Instead, one single topic wound up filling the whole time slot:
    how we format and indent Python code
    as a personal and intentional act of graphic design.

  <h2>Python Design Patterns 1</h2>
  <p>
    PyOhio 2012<br>
    Columbus, Ohio<br>
    <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/1369/python-design-patterns-1">video</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    I had recently seen a talk
    that dismissed the idea
    that Python programming involves design patterns,
    and I realized that I disagreed:
    there are all kinds of patterns emerging in the Python community,
    as well as widespread use of many of the classic patterns.
    As a first step towards the topic
    (hence the “1” in the talk title —
    it is, hopefully, the first of several talks on the subject),
    I look at the continuing popularity of many of the
    classic Gang of Four patterns even in modern Python programming.

  <h2>Python, Linkers, and Virtual Memory</h2>
  <p>
    PyCon 2012<br>
    Santa Clara, California<br>
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twQKAoq2OPE">video</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Another whirlwind technical introduction
    in the style of my previous talk on Python dictionaries.
    This time, I tackle how modern operating systems
    allocate and manage memory by using a simple example memory image
    that intends to capture all of the essential moving parts
    while being as simple in its details as possible.

  <h2>Flexing SQLAlchemy's Relational Power</h2>
  <p>
    PyCon 2012<br>

    Too often, programmers use ORMs to hide from their database
    and avoid learning how it works.
    Instead, I encourage programmers to learn a bit of SQL
    and become familiar with the problems that database queries
    are designed to solve well.
    In this talk, I outline the basics
    of using SQLAlchemy to craft efficient queries
    and avoid several common database query anti-patterns.
