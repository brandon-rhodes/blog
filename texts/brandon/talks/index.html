  Keynote<br>
  DjangoCon Europe 2013<br>
  Warsaw, Poland
  <p>
    I decided that Warsaw would be the perfect venue
    for reflecting upon how Mikołaj Kopernik —
    the Polish astronomer who published in Latin as Copernicus —
    faced the perennial problem of <b>refactoring</b>
    when he saw redundant code repeated all through
    Ptolemy's model of the solar system.

  PyCon 2013<br>
  Santa Clara, California
  <p>
    Continuing the aesthetics thread
    that started with my PyCon Canada talk,
    my PyCon talk explored several common practices
    for choosing names wisely when writing Python classes and functions
    — and suggested that good names are the lifeline
    that keep programmers afloat in a dynamic language
    where the name alone must communicate how a value ought to be used.
