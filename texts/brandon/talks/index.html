  A conference lasts only a few days.
  But when organizers are able to record the talks and keynotes,
  the event can impact thousands of people
  not able to attend the conference itself.
  Here are some of my own efforts to share what I have learned
  with the communities that have given me so much!

    Warsaw was the perfect venue
    for reflecting on how Mikołaj Kopernik —
    the Polish astronomer who published in Latin as “Copernicus” —
    faced the perennial problem of refactoring,
    when he saw redundant code repeated all through
    Ptolemy's model of the solar system.

    Continuing where my PyCon Canada talk left off,
    I explored several common practices for choosing names wisely
    when writing Python code
    — and suggested that apt names are the lifeline
    that keep programmers afloat in dynamic languages.
