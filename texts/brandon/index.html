I also have a page of links that lead to other people’s writing:

<ul>
  <li><a href="/brandon/essential-reading/">Essential Reading</a> —
    links to several articles
    that have been important to my own thinking,
    and that you might be interested in reading
    if some of my own ideas have interested you.
</ul>

<h2>Greatest Hits</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="talks/#mighty-dictionary">“The Mighty Dictionary” Talk</a>
    — My first big PyCon talk, and probably still my most popular.
  <li><a href="https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon-pandas-tutorial"
         >“Pandas From the Ground Up” Tutorial</a>
    — Hundreds of people have gotten started with the Pandas data library
    thanks to this tutorial,
    available as a YouTube video plus matching Jupyter notebooks.
    (Alas, the video also includes the conference coffee breaks.)
    I still keep the exercises up to date
    and make sure they work with the latest version of Pandas.
  <li><a href="https://python-patterns.guide/">Python Design Patterns</a>
    — A site where I’m writing up all of the old Gang of Four design patterns
    for Python programmers,
    weighing which ones are still useful in a modern dynamic language.
  <li><a href="https://github.com/skyfielders/python-skyfield">Skyfield</a>
    — A library that generates coordinates for stars, planets, and satellites
    using modern idiomatic Python.
  <li><a href="https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem">PyEphem</a>
    — My earlier foray into generating astronomy coordinates for Python.
    Still popular despite its awkward type conventions.

  <li><a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/">Semantic Linefeeds</a>
    — An essay advocating a practice from early in UNIX history:
    putting line breaks between sentences or phrases
    instead of when the line simply reaches a certain length,
    if you’re writing marked-up plain text
    that will be reformatted before the user reads it.
    The habit makes it easier to navigate, edit, and rearrange text.

  <li><a href="https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/logging_tree">logging_tree</a>
    — A small elegant companion for Python’s logging module.
    I am happy that one of my libraries, at least,
    still supports every Python version back to Python 2.3.
</ul>

<h2>Talks</h2>

You can either browse my <a href="talks/">full list of recorded talks</a>,
or else jump to the description of a particular talk
using one of the links below:

<table>
  % for date, target, title in talks:
  <tr>
    <td><i>{{ date.replace(u' ', u' ') }}</i></td>
    <td><a href="talks/#{{ target }}">{{ title }}</a></td>
  </tr>
  % end
</table>

<h2>Recent Writing</h2>

<p>
  Much of my most recent prose is at my site
  <a href="https://python-patterns.guide/">https://python-patterns.guide/</a>,
  a work-in-progress where I’m starting to assemble
  many of the ideas from my talks into writing.

  The posts I’ve made here on my personal site are:

<h2>Foundations of Python Network Programming</h2>

<a class="image-aside image-reference" href="https://amzn.to/2VhFy1v"><img alt="book cover" border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ASIN=1430258543&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=letsdisthemat-20&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" ></a>

<p>
  I have twice revised the book
  <a href="https://amzn.to/2VhFy1v"
     ><i>Foundations of Python Network Programming</i></a>
  for Apress Media.
  For the most recent Third Edition,
  I updated its code to Python 3
  and expanded coverage of libraries
  like Requests, Paramiko, and ØMQ.
  I have made all of the book’s example code
  available in this GitHub repository:
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/fopnp"
     ><b>All 108 Python example scripts from the book</b></a>
</p>

<p>
  Note that both of the links to the book (text and image) above
  are Amazon affiliate links,
  which generate a bit more income for an author
  than does an anonymous link —
  but you can also find the book through a quick search for its title.
