title: 'Fixing OpenConnect’s VPN Search Domains on Ubuntu'
---
<p>A quick technical note about VPN hostnames on Ubuntu Linux,
since otherwise I will forget:</p>
<p>If other users of your VPN can refer to hosts by an unqualified hostname,
but an Ubuntu user like you receives a <code>not found</code> error
for the same hostname,
then try creating the following file
(you will need to create the directory by hand).</p>
<!-- more -->
<p><code>/etc/vpnc/connect.d/cisco_split_dns</code></p>
<pre><code># Take each &quot;Cisco split domain&quot; defined by the VPN and add
# it to the &quot;search&quot; line in resolv.conf, so unqualified
# hostnames are searched for in all the subdomains that
# the network architects intended.

if [ -n &quot;$CISCO_SPLIT_DNS&quot; ]; then
    for domain in $(echo &quot;$CISCO_SPLIT_DNS&quot; | sed &quot;s/,/ /g&quot;)
    do
        CISCO_DEF_DOMAIN=&quot;$CISCO_DEF_DOMAIN
domain $domain&quot;
    done
fi
</code></pre>
<p>After creating the above file,
disconnect and reconnect to the VPN.
All of the unqualified hostnames that your co-workers enjoy
should now start working for you!</p>
<p>How did I develop this fix?</p>
<p>I suspected that the problem with hostname resolution
involved how <code>openconnect</code> sets the <code>search</code> line in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>.
For example,
connecting to a VPN might configure <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>
with a line like:</p>
<pre><code>search example.com
</code></pre>
<p>When a network program is given
a hostname that does not include a period —
an “unqualified” hostname that doesn’t specify its full domain —
it uses this <code>search</code> line to suggest possible domains for the host.
The command <code>ssh foo</code>, for example,
would check whether <code>foo.example.com</code> exists.
My guess was that the search line
was actually supposed to be longer
after connecting to the VPN, like:</p>
<pre><code>search example.com corp.example.com dev.example.com
</code></pre>
<p>This would make <code>ssh foo</code>
also check for <code>foo.corp.example.com</code> and <code>foo.dev.example.com</code>
if the name <code>foo.example.com</code> turned out to not exist.
But for some reason my <code>search</code> line was listing only a single subdomain.</p>
<p>I was daunted at the thought of trying to find a fix.
How could I possibly affect something as intricate
as how VPN software decides to configure my network,
without iterating through the time-consuming process
of patching the source and recompiling its binary?</p>
<p>It turns out, as I was delighted to discover,
that <code>openconnect</code> defers the step of configuring the local host’s network
to a plain-text shell script!
This is one of the glories of the UNIX tradition:
solving even system configuration problems, where possible,
with standard and transparent tooling.</p>
<p>When <code>openconnect</code> finishes negotiating the secure channel,
it calls a shell script named <code>vpnc-script</code>,
which is briefly described on its manual page:</p>
<pre><code>$ man openconnect

...

-s,--script=SCRIPT
       Invoke  SCRIPT  to  configure  the network after
       connection. Without this, routing and name  ser‐
       vice  are unlikely to work correctly. The script
       is  expected   to   be   compatible   with   the
       vpnc-script which is shipped with the &quot;vpnc&quot; VPN
       client.  See   http://www.infradead.org/opencon‐
       nect/vpnc-script.html for more information. This
       version of  OpenConnect  is  configured  to  use
       /usr/share/vpnc-scripts/vpnc-script by default.
</code></pre>
<p>I opened the default version of the script
and was happy to see that it was profusely commented.
Right at the top, it featured a long list of the environment variables
that <code>openconnect</code> sets before calling it.
Did there exist a setting on this particular VPN
that the script was not equipped to use?
I tried running <code>openconnect</code> with the verbose <code>-v</code> option
that was mentioned on the manual page,
and whole screenfulls of configuration data from the VPN
poured across my terminal window.
I perused them and quickly found:</p>
<pre><code>...
X-CSTP-Default-Domain: example.com
...
X-CSTP-Split-DNS: corp.example.com
X-CSTP-Split-DNS: dev.example.com
...
</code></pre>
<p>These “Split DNS” entries were the ones missing
from the <code>search</code> clause of my <code>resolv.conf</code>!
But how were these values delivered to the shell script?
I made a temporary edit atop the <code>vpnc-script</code>
to save all of its environment variables to a file:</p>
<pre><code>set &gt; /tmp/my-environment
</code></pre>
<p>Reconnecting to the VPN and then reading through this temporary file,
I saw that the environment variable
<code>CISCO_SPLIT_DNS</code> was the one I was looking for:
a comma-separated list of the missing subdomains.
How could I arrange for them to be added to <code>resolv.conf</code>?
One possibility would be to maintain my own version of <code>vpnc-script</code> —
but, happily, I found that the script’s behavior
could be manipulated from a separate file!</p>
<p>Using a few temporary <code>echo here &gt;&gt; /tmp/log</code> statements
to make sure I understood which decisions the script was making,
I learned that it assembled a small configuration file
in a variable <code>$NEW_RESOLVCONF</code>
that it then passed as input to a program I had never heard of
named <code>/sbin/resolvconf</code>,
that apparently is how modern Linuxes like Ubuntu
automate updates to their <code>resolv.conf</code> file.
Expecting <code>$CISCO_DEF_DOMAIN</code> to be a lone domain name,
the shell script adds it to the input it is building for <code>resolvconf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>domain $CISCO_DEF_DOMAIN
</code></pre>
<p>But there is no rule that <code>$CISCO_DEF_DOMAIN</code>
has to contain only one line —
if I supplemented it to include several additional lines of text,
then they would also be included in the input to <code>resolvconf</code>!
Is there any way I could get in
and tweak the value of <code>$CISCO_DEF_DOMAIN</code> before the script uses it?</p>
<p>I kept reading and, happily, discovered
that the script calls an internal routine <code>run_hooks connect</code>
before performing an actual connection.
The routine runs every file of shell commands
that it finds in the directory <code>/etc/vpnc/connect.d</code>.</p>
<p>And so the problem was solved!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I could add a file of my own to <code>/etc/vpnc/connect.d</code>
to supply code to run before <code>vpnc-script</code> did the rest of its work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The environment variable <code>$CISCO_DEF_DOMAIN</code>
would hold the hostnames I needed to add.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only impedance mismatch
was that <code>$CISCO_DEF_DOMAIN</code> is comma separated,
whereas the text I needed was several separate <code>search …</code> lines,
but a quick <code>for</code> loop could easily generate one from the other.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And so I wrote the short shell script at the top of this post,
disconnected from the VPN, reconnected,
and for the first time was able to use the unqualified hostnames
that had always worked for my coworkers on their Macs
but had never worked for me.</p>
<p>And the fix was easy, thanks to the time-tested UNIX practice
of plain-text shell scripts driving system configuration,
making even the details of VPN network setup
visible and extensible when they need to be.</p>
